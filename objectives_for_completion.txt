app is a proper course database

No need to crawl on ad classes because I found how the official nyuad website gets its courses - they maintain an XML file of everything and you just need to parse that

-> now they don't have one! So frustrating.


But yeah for other campus we need to crawl Albert
I can do the crawler part too if you don't want to
And for the app now the flask backend is literally reading the XML file I downloaded to local storage a year ago
I think if we have a database and a crawler (for AD it's just fetching a file), then we can regularly run the crawler and update our database





Basically I want a SQL database with a course table, so that we have a consistent format for course data

So probably just gonna have a 



majors:

major name,
major id,
pre requisites,




course:

course number,
course title,
instructor_id,
pre-requisites,
semester offered, 
course category (the requirements it satisfy),
course description,


But it could also be made much more sophisticated - which I think is kinda what NYU IT should be doing with their disorganized and inconsistent Albert course entries
