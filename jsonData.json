Although he has recently ceded that position to Chinese artists Zhang Daqian (1899-1983) and Qi Baishi (1864-1957), Warhol remains one of the most influential forces in contemporary art worldwide. From his famous Campbell&#39;s soup cans to his enduring aphorism that &quot;In the future, everyone will be world-famous for fifteen minutes,&quot; Warhol&#39;s art and thinking saturate contemporary culture. This seminar uses his diaries and other writing as a base-line against which we will examine his 25-year career as a painter, filmmaker, publisher and music producer, TV personality, and artistic mentor and collaborator, as well as his legacy in what has been described as our &quot;Warhol economy.&quot; What can Warhol&#39;s output and reception tell us about class, gender and sexuality, religion, and media over the last half century?

In this seminar, we read representative writings from several of the great Florentine thinkers of the period&mdash;Alberti, Machiavelli, Pico, and Galileo. Our goal is twofold: to discover what was original in each, and to grasp how all were connected by a shared set of ideals and beliefs. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to the main cultural monuments of Florence, where we see (among other wonders) the palaces and churches that Alberti designed, the telescope through which Galileo spied the moons of Jupiter, and the tomb where Machiavelli lies.</p>",

Florence has played a major role in these efforts and in the very idea of what modernity is. First, because Florence has remained intimately associated with the Renaissance, and thus with a literary, aesthetic, and scientific return to the Ancients. And second, because it is seen as a birthplace of modern political thought&mdash;especially republicanism and the theory of the state. In this class we will study the place of Florence in the modern imagination. We follow in the footsteps, both textual and actual, of thinkers who looked back to the past, and even at themselves, through the Florentine lens, and who asked what it means to be modern, to look to &ldquo;the ancients,&rdquo; and to look at the Renaissance as a cultural rebirth, by way of the city and its cultural heroes.</p>",

As a result, literature, theatre, painting, and music were reinvented according to a &ldquo;cinematic imagination.&rdquo; Engaging with Weimar cultural debates through the writings of artists and intellectuals who articulated the impact of film and photography on cultural developments, we will examine diverse artistic works and practices.

How can Berlin be understood as a symbol of urbanization today? What images of the city will emerge through our encounters? Finally, how can we understand the persistent power of visual media in shaping the global context today? The study of Weimar culture is interdisciplinary making it relevant to participants from diverse fields such as film, music, literature, art history, and history.</p>",

Students are expected to engage in a laboratory-based or field-based research project. However, under circumstances based on career trajectory, students may complete a theoretical treatise to explore a new and interesting idea in the life sciences that requires merging extant theories and data to develop novel and testable predictions about specific biological phenomena. The project is developed during fall of the third year as part of the Research Seminar in Biology. During the capstone research experience, students are fully immersed in the daily life of the laboratory. This approach allows students to experience the teamwork required to succeed in research and to foster a relationship with biology faculty who will act as their mentors. Upon completion of their project, students present and discuss the results of their work in a senior thesis following the formatting standards of a leading biology journal.</p>",

Baby songbirds retain the memory of hearing their father&rsquo;s song for several months before they actually are able to sing that song themselves. All these animals rely on specific mechanisms in their brains to endow them with these remarkable abilities. Understanding these mechanisms can provide deep insights into how all brains, including our own, are shaped by evolution to be fantastic problem solving machines. In this course we will explore the unique worlds of several animals, highlighting first the specific environmental problems that a particular animal must solve, and second, the amazing ways the brains of these animals implement imaginative solutions to these problems. This course does not presume a strong background in biology, but two things help: an appreciation of the beauty of the animals around us and a genuine curiosity about how in the world they are able to do what they do.</p>",

Focusing on paradigmatic artistic collaborations in the 20th century and also considering the impact of digital technologies in promoting intricate collaboration between different domains, we will look critically at the differences and tensions between the Romantic ideal of the <em>genius, </em>an <em>Artist </em>who assumes almost the role of a demigod, and at the ways in which that notion was challenged in the 20th century by the appearance of artist collectives and movements engaging in collaborative multidisciplinary work. Moreover, we will consider ways in which these approaches were the key to solving certain complex problems: for example, the development of computational technologies such as GUI-based operating systems. Students will develop collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, robotics and telematics, which will be presented publicly by the end of the semester. The course will take place at the Innovation Studio, a place equipped with several sound, light and image technologies that facilitate this type of work to be developed. Whenever possible, guests will be brought to class to discuss their work in the framework of collaborative efforts. This will include visiting artists to the Arts Center who engage in collaborative projects. When appropriate, students will be required to attend the performances by these artists.&nbsp;</p>",

In this colloquium, we will be reading a representative range of literary, political, and&nbsp;philosophical works from different cultures and chronological periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about death and immortality.&nbsp;So, for instance, we will examine arguments about the desirability of personal immortality from the perspective of both individuals and societies, and then gauge how&nbsp;these&nbsp;arguments might&nbsp;inflect our views about such things as recent innovative technological efforts to extend life and to ultimately achieve immortality--virtual or otherwise. By the&nbsp;same&nbsp;token, such goals raise larger political and societal questions about what sort of people we think there should be, how long they should live, and how many we&nbsp;think the planet (or the&nbsp;universe) can sustain. Students will be urged to confront such questions from a variety of moral, scientific, and cultural perspectives; to examine how views about death function in religion,&nbsp;in politics, in law, and in science; and to explore the role that death plays in the their own lives and in those of other peoples and societies.</p>",

But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, locating some particular function of the brain or &ldquo;neural correlate&rdquo;? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called &ldquo;the human condition&rdquo;? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any other single topic, have had something valuable to say? We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek, Christian and Jaina intellectual cultures, looking critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovsky; and at dissenters from William Hazlitt to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion&mdash;or, worse, a deceit.</p>\n\n<p>Human beings are subjective animals, and it is the essence of being human to experience the world subjectively, from a particular first-personal point of view. To be subjective, in this sense, is not the same as being biased or partial, although aspects of human awareness like emotion, which traditionally have been seen as the source of bias, have an important part to play in making experience subjective. Indeed, it might well be that subjectivity is one of the great universals of humanity, that what it feels like to experience the world in a first-personal way is a shared,&nbsp;common, part of human experience, unlike the subject-relativity of taste, vision, and feeling. On the other hand, it might equally be that the nature of subjective experience varies, that what it is like to have a subjective take on the world is different in, for example, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism or Christendom. The aim of the course will be to go in search of answers to such riddles as this. We&rsquo;ll look both at the history of subjectivity and at the latest work at the cutting-edge of investigations into the problemmatic nature of subjectivity. We will examine the question of the relation between self and other as a social phenomenon and in the workplace.</p>",

Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies with a decidedly multidisciplinary approach, and addresses their relevance to several &ldquo;global challenges&rdquo; of the Core Colloquia, namely Humanity, Equality, and Justice. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical and social-engineering projects, or the collusion of emotional and political regimes, the course further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. As part of this Core Colloquium, students are asked to think about emotions as global phenomena within networks of inter-cultural exchange, construction of meaning, and knowledge acquisition, as well as to develop Core Competencies in the areas of Structures of Thought and Society, and Cultural and Social Analysis.</p>",

The expression of &ldquo;loss&rdquo; of human dignity in slave narratives, in modernist writers and artists, and the post-war appropriation of the term by international institutions and national bioethics commissions, have led to a conceptual confusion provoking a backlash from the scientific community that dignity is an incoherent, useless, and &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; notion. Dignity, a concept elaborated for its emancipatory potential by Giovanni Pico (16th c) and Immanuel Kant (18th c), has come to serve contrary political ends. A series of historical investigations into philosophical definitions, artistic (visual and literary) expressions, key official documents, and contemporary personal narratives, will lead the class to ask what if anything of this notion the contemporary period may recover or conserve for emancipatory practices in our evolving world system.</p>",

This course will also consider the future of deserts in the global challenge context of climate change, desertification and resources (water, oil, solar). Students will encounter the desert through diverse sources that include film, literature, soundscapes, musical performances, environmental and social history, artistic production, fieldtrips, and travel writings. So, even while the desert is an environmental reality that makes inhabitation difficult, it is still a space of demographic, cultural, and economic activity and exchange.</p>",

As the world changes, questions of what appropriate moral conduct is naturally come into question. Yet some laws seem to have universal agreement across time and culture. Hammurabi&rsquo;s Code, 1760 BCE, is one of our oldest written records of nearly three hundred secular laws, and the Ten Commandments are both religious demands and a series of widely accepted moral and ethical standards. They are foundational in Islam, Judaism and Christianity. What do other religions have to say about how we regulate our lives? How do other societies challenge, structure and enforce their moral standards, separate and apart from religious doctrine? What place does our personal moral code have in the shadow of society&rsquo;s laws? Are all laws just? What role do the arts play in contesting the law, interpreting and reimagining it? &nbsp;Using a housing complex in 1980s Warsaw as the setting for ten short films &ndash; each based on one of the Commandments &ndash; writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski explores the nuances and relativity of ethics and morality. By examining up-close the ordinary dramas of everyday life, he leaves the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about the complexity of human morality and what constitutes right and wrong. In this course we examine each of Kieslowski&rsquo;s films in dialogue with literary and religious texts, ethical principles and precepts, and social, philosophical and theological criticism, to better understand what it means to obey the law.</p>",

This course will examine how our understanding of human physiology, genetics, and development, as well as methods of investigations of human anatomy, have shaped the perception of the human body, through history and across cultures. The course will examine the function of the body and how the understanding of bodily functions has changed (the working body). The course will also delve into the modifications the human body has experienced evolutionarily and how our own body is changing from a single cell until death (the changing body). Finally, the course will examine deviations from the typical body plan and the causes for these deviations (the abnormal body).

    "description": "<p>The development of science dealt a series of painful punctures to our perceived centrality in the universe, and in the process it upended many of the philosophical and theological doctrines grounded on that centrality. For example, the Copernican revolution &ndash; the discovery that the earth orbits the sun &ndash; led to radical changes in how humanity thought about its place in the universe, and these changes found expression in everything from science and philosophy to art and religion. More generally, scientific theories have gradually appropriated the explanatory domains once thought to be exclusive to philosophy and religion. Is there any role left, then, for philosophy and religion in a modern scientific world? How might reflection on this question allow us to better understand humanity&rsquo;s place in the universe? This course will investigate these questions through the lens of cosmology. The discipline of cosmology has revealed that our sun is a typical star out of billions in our galaxy, that our galaxy is one of billions in the observable universe, and it may be on the cusp of bringing about another revolution: &nbsp;that our entire observable universe is a tiny part of a vastly larger &ldquo;multiverse.&rdquo; What implications might this have for philosophy, religion, and our general understanding of ourselves as human beings? We will consider the intellectual history of cosmology and its 20th century transition into a modern scientific discipline, in addition to the contemporary frontiers of cosmological knowledge. What do we really know about the origin, fate, and large-scale structure of our universe? Given the likelihood that alien life exists, why haven&rsquo;t we encountered it? Are there reasons to think that the origins of the universe were &ldquo;fine-tuned&rdquo; for human existence, and does that create conceptual space for theological and philosophical considerations within modern cosmology? Should we even think that cosmology (and science more generally) is the appropriate tool for addressing existential questions about the nature of humanity?</p>",

This course examines the phenomena of scapegoating from both a historical and psychological perspective, and examines its treatment in films, literature, music, and new technology. Tracing the origins of scapegoating as a tribal rite and as one of the defining aspects of Greek tragedy, this course ultimately poses the question&mdash;what is it, in the human psyche, that causes us to demonize and dehumanize the &ldquo;other,&rdquo; and demand, in the most extreme cases, witch trials throughout the centuries, mob lynchings, the Holocaust, and the more recent genocide in Rwanda. This course also touches on the technological forms of scapegoating such as cyber-bullying and examines how the Internet itself is often used as a scapegoating device.</p>",

We pay particular attention to the ways in which personhood is aesthetically, psychologically, and politically theorized in different contexts. What does an individual&rsquo;s experience represent in specific art works? How is the relationship of individual experience to collective experience reconstructed in different arts works? Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist&rsquo;s oeuvre in relation to their personal life? In what ways do individual art works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities?

    "description": "<p>Memory is a dynamic process influenced by internal and external factors. Internally, a person&rsquo;s individual memory content is overwritten each and every time something is remembered. Externally, memory is determined by social practices and, not least, our physical environment, shaping what may be called social or collective memory. The stability of the physical environment is a guarantor of an individual&rsquo;s memory and, by implication, identity, to a much greater extent than individual memory itself; it was as early as 2000 years ago that the nexus of the urban space and a stable memory was established (Cicero, Quintilian). The class will focus on theoretical concepts of memory in the fields of the arts, technology and invention in antiquity and the 20th century (Warburg, Halbwachs, Nora), discuss a novel that satirically memoriZes the fall of the Wall (Brussig) and provide numerous field trips that exemplify the concepts of social/collective memory based upon the urban space of Berlin (the replacement of the GDR Palace of the Republic by a reconstructed City Palace, Holocaust Memorial, Sinti and Roma Memorial, Jewish Museum, book burning memorial, Berlin Wall, Berlin Museums, the 3rd Reich Germania project).</p>\n\n<p>*For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/global-education/jterm-application-nyu.html\">application</a>&nbsp;by October 15th.

Suspected of irrationality, emotion has continued to hold a contested position in the understanding of art. This course will explore the ways that art both expresses and arouses the emotions and to what value and ends. It asks how stories engage us in prototypical, emotional human situations such as suffering, separation, loss, recognition and reunion. We will think about what aspects of our emotional responses are universal, what are culturally specific, what are gendered, what are individual and personal, and the similarities and differences between art emotions and actual emotions. We will draw on a wide range of artworks from a variety of periods and cultures as case studies, including visual and narrative representations of the Passion of Christ; canonical love stories, like Laila Majnun and Romeo and Juliet; classical and modern tragedy; romantic, popular, and program music; and comic art like The Comedy of Errors and silent film comedy. These studies will be framed by the theories of, among others, Aristotle, Abhinavagupta, Tolstoy, Langer, Bergson, Freud, analytic philosophy (Carroll, Kivy), and cognitive theory (Hogan).</p>",

This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. &nbsp;The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE.

What about a significant loss of the sense of touch? What would that be like? The answer might not come readily due in part to the subtle, effortless performance of the sense of touch. Far from being just an immediate skin sensation, touching is intimately blended into embodied experiences that are affectionate, expressive, personal and interpersonal. Indeed, the haptic modality is the fundamental mode of access to the physical properties of the world. This course provides a multidisciplinary, cross-cultural introduction to the dynamics and salience of the human sense of touch, and runs a continuous thread for a number of fundamental questions and critical approaches that twenty-first-century haptic scholars embrace. A wide variety of interpretations, disciplines and experiences exploring the symbolic, cultural, ethical, social and technical aspects of haptic communication will be discussed. Topics covered in this course include social and cultural development, memory, learning, digital design, experiences of visual impairment, tactile therapies, human computer interaction, multimodal interaction and sensory substitution, funneling illusion and apparent motion, and privacy and security.</p>",

    "description": "<p>From its physical properties that create life to its metaphorical association with beauty and goodness, light is integral to our experience of being human. Playing out over the millennia, from the Chinese tradition of the Lantern Festival at the Lunar New Year to the current production and manufacture of LED components, our relationship with light has played a significant role culturally and materially in our understanding of the world around us. This course will examine the perceptual, psychological, and metaphorical ways in which we encounter light in stories, art and culture. We will examine texts from a variety of cultures that use light and darkness as a metaphor for good and evil and study the works of artists like James Turrell, Anthony McCall, Teddy Lo and Erwin Redl who work directly with light. Celebrations, rituals, and ceremonial use of light like the Diwali and the growth and use of pyrotechnics will be considered. &nbsp;The class will include a practical component in which students develop their own light-based works leveraging the unique and innovative resources of Shanghai as a means of exploring the materiality of light firsthand.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>NOTE: This course is open to NYUAD students only.</em></strong></p>",

Some of the earliest known cave art, dating back approximately 40,000 years, is abstract. The use of abstract forms in ornament and for symbolic communication is found at different periods of history and in different locations across the globe. And abstraction has become prominent in modern art all over the world. This course takes a comparative approach to abstraction and asks why human beings in different places and at different times have drawn and carved similar shapes, lines and patterns and what are the meanings of these forms? Why have some cultures with long traditions of representational painting turned to abstraction? How have religious, political and social contexts shaped this turn? What has been the role of abstraction in Islamic and other non-Western traditions and how have these traditions influenced Western art? Although the course will range widely historically and culturally, it will take the Middle East as one of its key areas of interest and will include visits to galleries, private collections and selected centers for traditional arts in the UAE.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pain is infamously difficult to describe. But go to the emergency room and you&rsquo;ll be asked to rate your pain on a scale of one to ten; for the sake of relieving pain, you have to be able to measure it, to articulate its experience. In the absence of bodily injury, descriptions of physical pain are often deployed as metaphors for emotional pain&mdash;but can we really call them metaphors? Recent scientific studies on the physiological effects of &lsquo;heartbreak&rsquo;, for example, have suggested that the line may not be quite so clear. At the same time, in many religions forms of self-inflicted pain carry both a metaphorical connection to the suffering of a holy figure (Imam Hussein in Shia Islam or Jesus in Christianity) and also a real, physical experience. Ideas of empathy and sympathy and expressions such as &ldquo;I feel your pain&rdquo; likewise suggest that there is something communicable and infectious about pain, as it seems to pull apart traditional distinctions between mind and body, self and other.</p>\n\n<p>This course focuses on the relationship between representations of pain and the way we respond to these: individually and collectively, culturally and medically, physically and emotionally. In particular, we will think about how artistic, religious, and popular representations of pain circulate and how they inform technologies and practices of pain relief, pain management and, in some cases, pain&rsquo;s deliberate infliction. We will engage with debates over the relationship between pleasure and pain, the ethics of &lsquo;witnessing&rsquo; without being able to stop the suffering of others, the aestheticization of pain, how race may shape our perceptions of others&#39; pain, and the involvement of medical professionals in practices of torture. Course readings will include philosophical treatises and scientific literature from a variety of cultural backgrounds and historical periods, as well as novels, poems, and plays.</p>\n\n<p>Possible writers/artists/phenomena include Susan Sontag, Fred Moten, Sara Ahmed, Michel Foucault, Elaine Scarry, Jacques Lacan, Marquis de Sade, Epicurus, Amiri Baraka, Sadegh Hedayat, Roberto Bola&ntilde;o, Franz Kafka, Societas Rafaello Sanzio, Frida Kahlo, Francis Bacon, Marina Abramovic, Lorenzo Bernini, Passion of the Christ, the Milgram Experiment</p>",

You can receive it from a priest in the confession box, from your friend or your neighbor, and lately it seems like something you hope to find at a bank. But if the latest round of &ldquo;debt forgiveness&rdquo; talks at the World Trade Organization are to have any meaning outside of international finance, it is time for a thorough review of the history of forgiveness. We&rsquo;ll track ancient ideas of forgiveness&mdash;think of it as the earliest form of jurisprudence: Hammurabi specifying an &ldquo;eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,&rdquo; or perhaps the limitless possibility of &ldquo;wiping the slate clean&rdquo; in the form of the jubilee&mdash;to the present, as contending theories of justice emerge and circulate in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the special role of the arts in instigating, pursuing, and sometimes refusing attempts to forgive or seek forgiveness, the course will focus especially on the efforts of artists and performers to resolve, represent, or even perpetuate conflict. Students will probe specific case studies that were successful, or that failed in achieving a just peace, and the healing required to move beyond the horrors of war, long standing repression and violations of human rights. These may include: Apartheid South Africa, the Rwandan Genocide, the Slave Trade and the American Civil Rights movement, post WWII Germany, the Bosnian conflict, Canada and the First Nations, and others. At its most prosaic, this class asks: how do people who have let each other down continue to live together? When and why do they decide to fight, or to invent courts, or to write books, or to sing songs?</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>&ldquo;An artist paints so that he will have something to look at; at times he must write, so that he will also have something to read.&rdquo; -- </em>Barnett Newman, 1947.&nbsp; This seminar explores different forms of artists&rsquo; writings across different cultures, with a primary emphasis on texts written since 1945. Whatever form an artist chooses for her/his writing (e.g. diary, essay, lecture, statement, open letter, magazine article, novel), we will approach the written text in relation to her/his art practice. The reason why artists not only make art objects but also write is generally that they feel they have something to say which nobody else (art critic or academic) would be able to say in their own language. This provokes the question: Do artists have a special way of thinking? How is their thinking connected to their art practice? Can we learn from artists to creatively interrelate experience and practical ambition as well as ways of thinking and writing? Artists&rsquo; writings provide a context for their work rather than an explanation. They open up new horizons for reflection on their works and on cultural situations. On the basis of a selection of texts from artists such as Lygia Clark, Yoshihara Jiro, Agnes Martin, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, and Andy Warhol we will observe how linguistic form and intellectual structure interfere, which strategies artists pursue to position themselves, and how the relationship between work and text is established. These theoretical studies will be accompanied by a practical task: learning from artists&rsquo; writings and experimenting with students&rsquo; own approach to writing in relation to their fields of study. On a regular basis seminar members will then discuss the texts each student produces in relation to the texts explored in class.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The course centers around the concept of &#39;Art and Agency,&#39; famously coined by the anthropologist Alfred Gell. The concept regards the idea that art works, pictorial images in general, and even objects at large, carry an agency factor, even possess an agency power that effects human beings &ndash; their mode of thinking, their emotions, their actions, their aesthetic experience etc. This concept has fundamentally impacted the way art theorists and art historians think about and analyze works of art. The course, offered at NYU&rsquo;s site in Berlin, introduces students to this fundamental concept, and brings it to bear with regard to three theories about the identity and workings of art that currently dominate the academic discourse on art and art history in, and beyond, Germany. Each of these theories, which in part are designed in response to one another, originates with a Berlin base university professor. Hans Belting, affiliated with Berlin&rsquo;s Free University, has introduced the concept of &lsquo;Bild-Anthropologie&rsquo; (&lsquo;Image Anthropology&rsquo;), which argues that there is a fundamental mirror-relationship between (material) images and the human body. &nbsp; &nbsp;The theoretical part will consist of morning sessions during which these &lsquo;Bild&rsquo;-theories will be discussed, also in the presence of some of their Berlin protagonists. The afternoon sessions will be devoted to in-situ analyses of individual &lsquo;Bilder&rsquo; in some of Berlin&rsquo;s most prominent museums: the &lsquo;Gem&auml;ldegalerie&rsquo; (Old Master painting); the &lsquo;Nationalgalerie&rsquo; (19th century art), the Bode Museum (Sculpture); the Kunstgewerbe Museum (Applied Arts), and the Museum for Prehistory and Early History.

Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world&rsquo;s lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us the perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>NOTE: This course is open to NYUAD students only.</em></strong></p>",

Scientists wanted to understand the power that hides in the gene and the effects of its manipulation. The Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003 led to the identification of the genes in the Human DNA. This discovery is now leading the way to trying to understand the roles of those genes in our bodies, the diseases that may result from their malfunctioning, and consequently treating those diseases at the gene level. This growing field is known as Gene Therapy. In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy. This course travels through the world of genetics and examines the Human Genome Project, successful stories and challenges in the field of Gene Therapy, Genetically Modified Foods, and Cloning; all being topics that have fundamental implications on the society that will live in and contribute towards.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, the range of validity of models, approximations, data outliers, competing interpretations: scientists spend most of their time wrestling with these problems. Unfortunately, in classrooms and in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. If uncertainty is acknowledged, it is often portrayed as an argument between two groups of experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well established facts, and scientists occasionally have clear-cut divisions of opinion, more commonly they have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about the significance of a particular measurement or study. In this class, we familiarize ourselves with the language of probability and statistics, explore how it developed historically to become central to the scientific process, and how it is used by different scientific disciplines. We discuss how scientists express their ignorance, and how individuals and policy makers can still make judgments based on incomplete scientific knowledge. We also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs. Finally, we discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, we can still put limits on our uncertainty.</p>",

It sometimes strongly challenges common sense and produces extraordinary dreams of human history. &nbsp;The course concerns questions and concepts from various areas in mathematics, in particular number theory: the ``alarm clock numbers&#39;&#39; and some of their applications (for example to music) ; irrational numbers and their intimate links with art and geometry as well as the scandal raised by their discovery in ancient Greece ; the Golden Ratio with its surprising mathematical properties, its connections with biology through Fibonacci sequences and art history; prime numbers and their chaos, order and mystery ; the fantastic number &pi;, some of its properties, and messy and beautiful formulae to approach it ; continued fractions, the sum of two-squares theorem ; the five (or three) Platonic solids from prehistory to modern times ; some amazing paradoxes raised by probabilities ; and Poincar&eacute; finite-infinite universe. Through these and other examples we will consider how and why mathematics is a subversive intellectual activity, relying on passion, imagination, and beauty as much as on logic and rigorous argumentation.</p>",

While these subjects are quite daunting, the course will pursue a conceptual approach that is accessible to students. Topics and questions will include: First, what does infinity really mean from the math point of view? This seemingly simple question is one of the deepest in math. The currently proposed answers all solve many problems but also lead to some non-intuitive consequences. Second, is there a unifying theme in mathematics? That is, is there a set of principles and a common language underlying all branches of mathematics? If so, would this set be complete? Consistent? Third, seeking a theory of everything in physics would unify all the forces of nature (electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces, and gravity) via combining quantum theory and general relativity. Is this a reasonable quest? Is it attainable? What would its consequences be? Fourth, to what extent are the above quests in math and physics related? Are unifying themes in one aspect of nature (e.g. physics) expected to reflect similar themes in another aspect (e.g. math)?</p>",

Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism.

If man, as Hannah Arendt famously put it, is <em>homo faber</em>, the &ldquo;creator,&rdquo; the tool-making animal, then from at least Plato to the present, human beings have been telling stories about how to use tools correctly and about how dangerous they can be. This course investigates the ways philosophical writing, novels, plays, and films have dramatized the vexed relationship between human beings and the technologies they create. What is at stake in the creation of tools and technologies? Why are human beings, perhaps now at the start of the twenty-first century more than ever, sp enamored with technological progress? Why is <em>technophilia</em>, the love of technology, so often accompanied by its opposite, <em>technophobia</em>, the fear of technology? What do the attitudes represented in the texts and films we are reading tell us about the dynamics of human agency and about the relationship between science and religion? Texts and films come from a variety of world cultures and include <em>Alif the Unseen</em>, <em>Arabian Nights</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>, <em>The Caves of Steel, Metropolis</em>, <em>Paradise Lost</em>, <em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>R.U.R.

Is the value of men measured by the value of their money, or are there other criteria for wealth? Is someone&rsquo;s wealth possible without someone else&rsquo;s poverty? How is human ambition rewarded or punished in the &ldquo;pecuniary culture&rdquo;? The course looks for answers to these and other questions in key works of literature, sociology, economics and other fields, reading classical texts ranging from Aristophanes&#39; Plutus, Ihara Saikaku&#39;s &quot;A dose of what the doctor never orders,&quot; and William Shakespeare&#39;s The Merchant of Venice, to Honor&eacute; de Balzac&#39;s P&egrave;re Goriot, Daniel Defoe&#39;s Robinson Crusoe and F.

In the attempt to restore health, the relationship between patient and doctor is of central importance and therefore constitutes a thematic focus for this course.

Is this something conscious? Does it include the mind? Does it survive death? How exactly?&nbsp; Will it be judged, as Plato and Socrates thought and many religions suggest? We will explore these ideas from the Greeks through the Christians and Muslims, reading Homer, Plato, Augustine and Ibn Sina.&nbsp; The class will conclude with a glimpse at the late Renaissance, when the permanence and even presence of human souls became more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in the ancient and medieval worlds.&nbsp; In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way, whether to faith--or away from it.</p>",

While modern science is increasingly blurring the supposed demarcation line between animals (equalling nature) and humans (equalling reason), literature has allowed for transgressions that have worked both ways: transformations go from human to animal and vice versa. Not only this; throughout history animals have been thought to possess human qualities (and also: vice versa) such as speech and reason and have been represented to act in a way that often seems more human than the way humans behave. The class starts with the earliest literary document of mankind, The Epic of Gilgamesh, looks at texts from Antiquity and the Middle Ages from various civilisations (Aesopus, The Jataka Tales, The Panchatantra, Apuleius, Lucian, The Physiologus, The Journey to the West) and up to modern times (Darwin, Carroll, Kipling, Kafka, Dick) and also one film which especially reflects upon the strained relationship to an animal and man&rsquo;s self-perception in the face of nature (Moby Dick).</p>",

How did these narratives define &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and shape international abolitionist publics? How might we read them for evidence of slave culture and community, and imaginaries of race, gender, and nation? &nbsp;How do novels and films serve as sites of public memory --or amnesia -- about slavery?

The study of globalization further emphasizes detachment from the material world and privileges movement over locale. Consequently this emphasis on migration tends to position mobility and rootedness as opposite poles, often celebrating the former and neglecting or even devaluing the latter. The question is how a sense of place can persist in the face of all this movement and interaction.&nbsp; This course will consist of theoretical and fictional texts which make a case for revisiting the question of a global sense of place. How does the experience of displacement or contact with the outside change our relation to place? Is there a reaction to place that transcends nostalgia for lost origins?&nbsp; If displacement is valued over placement do the experiences of men predominate? The theoretical and fictional readings will center on the shaping force of place in human experience and the primacy of setting and landscape in narratives.</p>",

In Confession we think about confession as a religious and cultural practice and ask what, why, and how do people confess through writing and performance? If confession is no longer religiously determined, what possesses us as humans to confess our secrets, and why do readers and spectators care? Furthermore, how does secular confession operate in a globalized world? Do confessional practices traverse the globe? By broadening the Christian definition of confession and drawing on student generated material, we will examine confession from an intercultural point of view and think about what we can learn about a culture by the kind of secrets it keeps and the nature of its confessional practices. Students should expect to read Hannah Arendt, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Rustom Barucha, Joan Didion, Sigmund Freud, Allen Ginsberg, Koffi Kwahul&eacute;, Jean Racine, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>",

Once in a while, however, an extraordinary book may launch a revolution, alter national policy, divide a nation, or unite a continent. Why does this happen to some, but not others? This question seems especially pertinent since a novel is always a hopeful act towards a better world &mdash; in both its writing and its reading. This seminar examines the textual, literary, historical, and social circumstances that aligned to allow certain works of fiction to change the facts of our existence. The novel is a relatively young art form that began as entertainment, but its instructive empathy for other ways of being has created an invaluable conversation across borders and between eras. That is why novels are censored or celebrated, why they have been banned or become best-sellers, why they are used for propaganda or advocacy, and why they remain a vital part of the human experience. This seminar examines the social impact of such novels as Jose Rizal&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Touch Me Not</em>, Harriet Beecher Stowe&rsquo;s<em>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</em>, Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>The Jungle</em>, Chinua Achebe&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Things Fall Apart</em>, Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>The Satanic Verses</em>, Multatuli&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Max Havelaar</em>, Ding Ling&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River</em>, and more.

A number of cataclysmic events have afflicted the Arab world in recent years, yet filmmakers have persisted in their desire to tell their stories, against the odds, in creative acts that attest to their imagination, courage and resilience. While news reporting tends to present crisis in abstract, humanitarian or Orientalist terms, how do filmmakers build new perceptions, rather than merely confirming existing ones? This course reflects on these questions, together with the often-fraught relationship between art and politics. Starting with a critical interrogation of the terms &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;creativity,&rdquo; we will explore various creative strategies for depicting crisis in contemporary cinema. Although our main reference-point will be films from and about the Arab world, specifically, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, we will also build comparisons with films from Iran, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Denmark, UK, USA, Spain, India and elsewhere.

To this day, individuals routinely sort themselves in to groups based on share political, social, religious, or cultural beliefs. In turn, these sorted groups often find themselves at polar extremes from one another, something that has often led to intense, and sometimes violent, conflict. In this course, we will explore the history, emergence, and pervasiveness of various kinds of polarization: ethnic, linguistic, religious, political, and geographic. We will begin the course by defining polarization and looking at examples of it from antiquity to the present. Thereafter, we will look at the consequences of polarization for politics, social interactions, and economics. The course will be taught using classical works by kings and statesmen (e.g., Constantine of Rome, Louis XIV of France, Woodrow Wilson), as well as contemporary scholarship from a diverse group of scholars: historians, demographers, political scientists, biologists, and economists. Special attention will be given to social media and social networking, a pervasive aspect of contemporary social polarization; it will serve as the basis for a course-long project.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Prerequisites:&nbsp;</em>None; some familiarity with social networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn) and Microsoft Excel would be useful, but not required.</p>\n\n<p><em>* Please note the duration of this course during summer 2013 is 26 May-12 June.

They differ, for example, in whether they address one God, no gods or many; how important they think explicit creeds are; how much attention they give to prayer, fasting and other rituals; and whether adherents are expected to dress or eat or engage in other everyday practices in a distinctive way. In this course we&rsquo;ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science&mdash;E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim.

How do we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security in a world characterized by increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of state and private surveillance? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, paying particular attention to the ways in which certain major events (such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States) have shaped how we think about surveillance and its relationship to privacy, security, and democracy.</p>\n\n<p>*For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/global-education/jterm-application-nyu.html\">application</a>&nbsp;by October 15th.

We trace the history of the development of money and credit across societies to the present day. We explore the centrality of money to various cultures and its representation in the arts. We discuss governmental manipulation of aggregate monetary stocks to spur or dampen trade; or historically to finance conflict by debasing the value represented by this peculiar good. We explore a central truth, that while modern money is intrinsically meaningless, its role in facilitating economic growth in the supply of real goods and services is surprisingly robust, provided policy does not deliver problems when too much money and credit is in circulation.</p>",

As the world changes, questions of what appropriate moral conduct is naturally come into question. Yet some laws seem to have universal agreement across time and culture. Hammurabi&rsquo;s Code, 1760 BCE, is one of our oldest written records of nearly three hundred secular laws, and the Ten Commandments are both religious demands and a series of widely accepted moral and ethical standards. They are foundational in Islam, Judaism and Christianity. What do other religions have to say about how we regulate our lives? How do other societies challenge, structure and enforce their moral standards, separate and apart from religious doctrine? What place does our personal moral code have in the shadow of society&rsquo;s laws? Are all laws just? Using a housing complex in 1980s Warsaw as the setting for ten short films &ndash; each based on one of the Commandments &ndash; writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski explores the nuances and relativity of ethics and morality. By examining up-close the ordinary dramas of everyday life, he leaves the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about the complexity of human morality and what constitutes right and wrong. In this course we examine each of Kieslowski&rsquo;s films in dialogue with literary and religious texts, ethical principles and precepts, and social, philosophical and theological criticism, to better understand what it means to obey the law.</p>",

Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism.

Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary.

This question, perhaps the most important question facing China (indeed the world) over the next few decades, pits economy and environment against one another.

Are there solutions? Or are there better ways of asking the question?

Studying love is central to understanding how Africans have imagined and lived their lives as gendered individuals and members of their societies, often in the face of oppressive colonial regimes and strenuous living conditions. The course will view love in its various declensions: as an emotion and expression of intimacy (the notion of romantic love), as virtue (love in theological and political discourses), as a set practices at the chore of conjugality and sexuality, and as an object of debate in the public sphere. Students will learn how to historicize affects and their relationships to society, politics, and economy.

Our chief concern, however, will be the project of empire. How and why did the Romans come to possess such a vast empire? How did they perceive their realm? Why were they able to put this thing together? Furthermore, we will have one special concern in all of this. There was one geographical region, which the Romans tried repeatedly to conquer, and to hold. They never succeeded at this. That area is, roughly speaking, the modern Middle East. So, one of our chief questions will revolve around the fact that the Romans were so successful elsewhere, yet, for the most part, failed in their imperial project here. Can this be explained in terms of their imperial project writ large? There is, to my knowledge, no scholarly literature dealing with this question specifically, and as a whole. Therefore, we will get at the matter via a consideration of Roman expansionism, as this played itself out against the background of Roman history altogether.</p>",

It is a narrative of codification and the books of law, of scriptural texts and the casuistry that they generate. The first moment of legal study is that of inaugural texts and collections, of sovereignty, its representation and its textual delegation. The course will introduce the hierarchy of sources of law, the process of enacting law, the concepts of norm and rule, and then the plural regime of legal interpretation of sources, the hermeneutics of practice. Beginning with the concept of the Code, the course will proceed to the topics of Statutory interpretation, systems of Precedent, and forensic rhetoric in distinct substantive legal disciplines. As the English legal sage Sir Edward Coke put it, inevitably in Latin, nemo nascitur artifex &ndash; no one is born a lawyer. To this end, the methods course will also entail and be supported by a vigorous legal writing and research program.</p>",

This course examines the ethical issues raised by the function of law and lawyers in protecting individual rights and advancing the common good. The course considers a variety of possible ethical theories such as natural law, positivism, idealism, utilitarianism, legal realism, interpretivism, deconstructionism, critical legal theory, and post-modernism as foundational to the rules governing the ethics and professional responsibility of lawyers. The increasing globalization and transnational practice of law warrants a comparative perspective on the similarities and differences between jurisdictions with regard to specific issues in legal ethics. Legal materials are drawn from a variety of jurisdictions, such as Australia, China, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States, in order to elucidate the relevant issues in legal ethics. Among the issues addressed are the legal profession and professional identity, trust, truth telling, confidentiality, conflict, client autonomy, access to legal services, cause lawyering, ethical breaches, and malpractice. In addressing these issues, the course involves lectures and class discussion of the readings. Additionally, the course also employs student participation in various ethical scenarios, and this methodology not only permits exploration of the facts and rules with regard to the ethical issues, but also assists students to develop skills that are essential to good lawyering such as client interviewing, negotiation, alternate dispute resolution, mediation, and reconciliation.</p>",

Columbus reportedly had a copy of Al-Idrisi&rsquo;s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Students in this course will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of US American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies.

We will approach the study of Shakespeare through three different sets of questions: 1) In what ways was Shakespeare a &ldquo;global&rdquo; author in his own day, adopting a &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; approach that transcends his English context? 2) How does the history of the publication, performance, and criticism of his plays transform &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; into a global cultural commodity? 3) What is the cultural legacy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work throughout a variety of global media forms, including plays, films, novels, operas, and works of visual art? We will begin by looking at two plays, Othello and The Tempest, that have inspired adaptations in a variety of cultural contexts and genres. We will then devote a number of classes to investigating the global spread of Shakespeare&rsquo;s most famous play, Hamlet, from 1603 to the present.

How did love (earthly or divine) figure in the poetic personae and works of writers?<br />\nHow was poetic creation different from other states such as madness or prophecy? How did medical, philosophical, legal and ethical discourses frame the questions of poetry and madness?&nbsp; Is the representation of poetic madness and inspiration in Arabo-Islamic discourse similiar or different from other traditions? This course will explore these themes (and others) in great detail through the intensive study of early Islamic poetry, Sufi mystics, *Maq\u0101m\u0101t*, *Arabian Nights*, Persian Romances,as well as numerous philosophical,ethical, and medical treatises. Students will also be invited to draw comparisons with&nbsp;similar themes in other traditions of South Asia, East Asia, and Western Europe.</p>",

The rise in interest in the postcolonial condition has been marked by a body of work that engages questions relating to empire and decolonization and creates new models for the analyses of power, identity, gender, resistance, nation and Diaspora. In this class, we will examine fiction, poetry, film, and political writings from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and their diasporic communities.

And they&#39;re writing about it. There&#39;s a global wave of books about cities, from Karachi to Cairo to Chicago. In this course, we will look at writers such as Dickens, Calvino, Jane Jacobs, Mahfouz, and others to see how best to write about the urban experience. We will examine the impact of climate change, inequality, and mass migration on global cities. We will consider issues of local politics, real-estate development, and urban planning, as they are reflected in official and unofficial narratives of city life.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Syjuco Advanced Creative Writing:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The novel may be the most demanding of literary forms to write, but to us readers it is also the most familiar.

Requiring dedication, deep characterization, confidence with structure, a poetic relationship with prose, and an engaging story, a novel is definitely a huge undertaking &mdash; yet its familiarity makes it come surprisingly naturally. This course will offer the tools, guidance, and support to help you create the first draft of the book you&rsquo;ve always wanted to write. Just as people train together then run together in a marathon, we&rsquo;ll do the same &mdash; spending a semester discussing the art of the novel, doing exercises to prepare us, charting your course, then writing our way from beginning to the end.</p>\n\n<p><em>Students in the NYUNY Creative Writing Dept: This course is equivalent to CRWRI-UA 816 Intermediate Fiction Workshop.</em></p>",

Robben Island in South Africa and Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland are still within the realm of living memories while slave castles in Ghana and slave dungeons on Zanzibar are not. What impact does distance in time and place have on this type of heritage? How does the practice of both remembering and forgetting affect the interpretation of these painful heritage sites? The students will study this practice by conducting field research at the slave castles in Ghana. Through interviews and observations they will explore the process of heritage production, the function of heritage, and the role of memory and identity.</p>",

In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what&nbsp;types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional&nbsp;justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly&nbsp;and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence.&nbsp;This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous&nbsp;options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and&nbsp;ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section&nbsp;introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the&nbsp;most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and&nbsp;reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international&nbsp;tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and&nbsp;Sierra Leone.</p>\n\n<p><em>Students in the NYUNY Sociology Dept: This course counts for Sociology elective credit.</em></p>",

How do our mental states and attitudes, whatever&nbsp;they are, arise from activity in the brain and cause our actions?

This course examines&nbsp;various questions concerning the nature and&nbsp;practice of science that arise from this widespread&nbsp;attitude. For example, scientific theories are&nbsp;often thought to be subject to empirical scrutiny&nbsp;in ways that other theories are not. To what&nbsp;extent is this belief well-founded? Is it rational to&nbsp;believe that our best scientific theories are even&nbsp;approximately true? What justifies the claim that&nbsp;different types of evidence lend varying degrees&nbsp;of support to a particular theory, or that a single&nbsp;piece of evidence supports one theory more than&nbsp;another? Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific&nbsp;theories provide us with &ldquo;real&rdquo; explanations of&nbsp;physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;&ldquo;genuinely explanatory.&rdquo; To what extent is this&nbsp;true? What exactly is a scientific explanation, and&nbsp;how is it different (if at all) from a mere prediction&nbsp;or mathematical derivation? Can false theories&nbsp;provide good explanations?

Philosophers have claimed that it is impossible to be conscious of anything unless one attends to it; cognitive psychologists that attention is a fundamental cognitive function of working memory; novelists that attention is a cardinal virtue and a good in itself. Philosophers in South Asia have claimed something else for attention: that attention is essential to our identity as individuals and to our acknowledgement of others in social interaction. They have levered the notion of attention to construct accounts of human existence that are radical both in their divergence from the conception of persons inspired by the Abrahamic religions and in their cosmopolitan implications for social and political solidarity. Course readings will consist of classical and contemporary studies of attention across several philosophical traditions. Particular emphasis will be on the Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma understanding of persons as beings with a capacity for attention, a view that shapes conceptions of humanity in South and Southeast Asia.

For that, clues left at the staged crime scene and beyond are analyzed using a combination of advanced scientific techniques (biological, chemical, and physical) typically used in forensics. In the lecture part of the course, the modern science and technology behind the techniques of forensic analysis are explored in depth. These tools of forensics are rooted in the fields of physics, physical chemistry, chemical physics, analytical chemistry, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. Examples include light microscopies, scanning electron microscopy and materials analysis, x-ray spectroscopies, various spectroscopies used for molecular identification such as infrared and Raman spectroscopies, mass spectroscopy and chromatography, electrophoresis, forensic serology, DNA sequencing, and next generation techniques.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The course also looks at the variations in institutional arrangements within both democratic and non-democratic governments.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Recommended Prerequisites: Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110), Introduction to Political Thinking (POLSC-AD 130)</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course is equivalent to </em><em>POL-UA 500 Comparative Politics </em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down.

We will study the history and the social construction of the state, of &ldquo;nation-states&rdquo;, of nations. We will then turn to the concept of nationalism, and evaluate the classical theories by considering empirical studies, adopting different angles and use international comparative examples. Nationalism is generally thought of as anti-liberal and hardly compatible with mature forms of democratic polities. Not only is this a historical error, but new and &ldquo;thin&rdquo; forms of nationalism have proven to be compatible with liberalism. Social justice, solidarity and integration of immigrants are often bound to national policies. The question whether particular forms of nationalism are desirable in multicultural settings will be left open for discussion. We will finally move on to transnational dimensions of identity: the recent boom of &ldquo;diaspora studies&rdquo;, the audience of &ldquo;legal or political cosmopolitanism&rdquo;, &ldquo;constitutional patriotism&rdquo; (in Europe in particular), or &ldquo;status group legal pluralism&rdquo; (regarding ethnies, historical nations, and religious groups), will serve as theoretical guidelines to understand how globalization shapes new forms of &ldquo;long-distance nationalism&rdquo; on the one hand, of new legal arrangements which serve to protect (national, ethnic, religious) minorities on the one hand, but seem at odds with democratic justice on the other hand.</p>",

In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. In this course climate change will be taken as a case study and the many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis will be considered. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. In December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate agreement in Paris, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2&deg;C. The Paris Agreement will be open for signature at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the newly adopted climate change agreement. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing various governments in making progress with ratification process. It will try to seek the answers of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by Paris Agreement for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it be applicable to all Parties including the United States and China? Is the Paris Agreement a treaty? And is it the type of international agreement to which the United States is a party only if the US Senate ratifies it? The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC. In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Subsequent attacks in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere have focused the world&rsquo;s attention on the problem of Islamic terrorism. In this class we will seek to understand both the causes of the sudden rise of violent extremism in the Muslim world and the response it has provoked. This course will examine the evolution of the threat, from Al Qaeda, with its focus on mounting spectacular attacks on symbolic targets in the West, to the Islamic State, which has attracted thousands of men and women from around the world to its violent nation-building project in the heart of the Arab world. Western nations have deployed military, intelligence and police tactics against Al Qaeda with some success, but those methods may not work against ISIS. Arab nations have begun to mobilize to counter the threat, but their own repressive, and in some cases religiously intolerant, regimes may be exacerbating the very problem they seek to solve. In addition to reading about the origins and the spread of jihadism and the policies adopted by concerned states, we will meet with scholars, journalists, policy experts, diplomats and officials in the Obama administration. Students will write a series of short papers as well as a longer project proposing a course of action to cure, or at least mitigate, the extremist threat.</p>",

The UN system, comprised of multiple organs, programs, funds and agencies, is a critical actor in international politics. It performs a large variety of daunting tasks ranging from keeping the peace in war-torn countries to fighting the spread of contagious diseases and facilitating negotiations to limit climate change&rsquo;s impact. While its status as the preeminent international organization is undisputed, its member states limit the UN&rsquo;s authority and both governments and NGOs frequently critique its structure and effectiveness. This course rigorously explores why the UN was established in 1945, how it has evolved, what challenges it faces today and whether avenues exist for meaningful organizational reform. The course will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of the UN&rsquo;s activities and will encourage students to use different theoretical approaches and available empirical evidence to think creatively about how the UN can more effectively address global challenges.</p>",

Students will study how other higher functions such as attention, learning and working memory contribute to our visual experience of the world. Both functional and neurophysiological models of visual processing are addressed. An introduction to signal detection theory is provided. The course covers theoretical issues about vision, in particular whether perception constitutes a direct reflection of the outside world or rather inferential processes transforming the outside world into a private subjective reality. The course also addresses how one can design psychophysics experiments to address specific questions about the architecture and mechanisms of visual cognition. Students will see how visual illusions can inform us on how our brain deals, sometimes inappropriately, with external stimulations.</p>\n\n<p>* Note:&nbsp;previously taught in Spring 2014 and Spring 2015 as <em>Special Topics in Psychology: Visual Cognition.</em></p>",

Along the way we explore the early modern Jewish ghettos of Frankfurt, Prague and Rome; Nazi-controlled ghettos in Poland during World War II; Jewish immigrant ghettos of early 20th-century New York and Chicago; and Black ghettos in northern U.S. cities from World War II to the present. Efforts to generalize to gay communities, Chinatowns, and barrios are also considered.

The third part of the course provides an overview of the public policy and legal frameworks shaping women&rsquo;s work. In particular, this section of the course explores how different categories of &ldquo;women&rdquo; are produced through public policy programs such as workforce nationalization, education policy, social policy, and the interplay of national and international laws governing domestic work, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The course will host a number of academics, activists, and policymakers involved in policies shaping women&rsquo;s work experiences in the Gulf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

The course begins with an exploration of theoretical and conceptual perspectives on urbanization and welfare state policies, then moves on to examine illustrative cases from global north and south cities that challenge and complicate reigning theories and concepts. The course begins with an historical and contemporary analysis of urban poverty in Global North cities (New York, Paris and London), then moves on to an examination of emergent urban poverty patterns and cases in rapidly-changing &ldquo;semi-peripheral&rdquo; regions (China, for example), and finally explores urban poverty in a wide variety of Global South cities (spanning Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia). The course will use examples from the United States to explore certain key topics/concepts for debate, such as &ldquo;underclass,&rdquo; &ldquo;informality,&rdquo; &ldquo;feminization of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;culture of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;prison industrial complex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;neo-liberal welfare state retrenchment.&rdquo; Students will be asked to compare and contrast historical and contemporary patterns of urban poverty across global north and south regions, with a focus on the limits and possibilities of social policies (state- and non-state-sponsored) for addressing urban distress.</p>",

For example, the course will elucidate connections between neighborhood (e.g. residential, social and work) characteristics (e.g. crime rate, density of fast food restaurants, distance to parks) and multiple health outcomes (e.g. obesity, mental health, substance use). The course will provide students with a historical, theoretical and methodological overview of the dynamic and re-emerging field of Spatial Epidemiology. This is an introductory-level course; as such, the course is intentionally broad, covering a range of issues and topics (e.g. neighborhood characteristic assessment methods, methods to examine neighborhood boundaries, identification of spatial clusters [&ldquo;hot spots&rdquo;] of disease, quantitative methods to evaluate connections between neighborhoods and health, and connecting neighborhoods to health disparities).</p>",

What are the new tools and institutions of this new colonialism? How has this affected development and social struggle? The class will be organized around themes and corresponding case studies.

The social turn explicitly rejects the artist&rsquo;s more traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance and instead proposes that the conscious processes of collaborative engagement -- activist, participatory, coauthored &ndash; must be understood and valued as art.&nbsp; In this intertwining of art with performance, cooperative processes are foregrounded as frameworks to understand and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art history, urban planning, and new media on our lives. The social practice of art proposes that in making encounters where artists engage with the members of communities as &ldquo;expert participants,&rdquo; we might construct more livable alternatives through social cooperation.&nbsp; Art as social practice also insists that this process is an aesthetic practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this course we will read recent critical theories and histories of the aesthetics and politics of the social practice of art, explore case studies of &ldquo;relational art,&rdquo; and collaborate on our own &ldquo;living as form&rdquo; project.</p>",

We&rsquo;ll critique the plays as both literature and dramatic texts intended for production. What is clearly evident in African women playwrights&rsquo; writing is its focus on women&rsquo;s agency; generational legacies; tradition, colonialism, and modernism; tribal and national identities; family relationships; intimacy and commitment; the spirit world of rituals, polytheism, and monotheism; the challenging coexistence between Christianity and Islam; the impact of the global diaspora on African identity; and the intersecting issues of blackness, Africanness, and womanhood. The course will address these various foci through the works of Andiah Kisia (Kenya), Nathalie Etoke, Werewere Liking (Cameroon), Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe), Fatima Gallaire (Algeria), Penina Mlama, Amadina Lihamba (Tanzania), Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua Sutherland (Ghana), Osonye Tess Onwueme, Zulu Sofola, Julie Okoh (Nigeria), Sindiwe Magona, Malika Ndlovu, Gcina Mhlope (South Africa), Violet Barungi, and Deborah Asiimwe (Uganda). The foundational critical theories for the course are postcolonialism, feminism, critical race theory, and diasporic studies. We will also engage the new plays by African women that are produced at the 2nd Annual Kampala International Theatre Festival (Nov 25-29, 2015) through the assistance of award-winning Ugandan playwright, Deborah Asiimwe, who is co-director of this East African theatre festival (as well as the representative for the Sundance Institute East Africa).</p>",

From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the UAE State Calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.</p>",

The history of Eden in the art of the Peoples of the Book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and this seminar examines both. Students will study gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. To analyze these works, the course introduces fundamental methods of art history as an academic discipline.

According to Alan Licht, the term &ldquo;Sound Art&rdquo; dates back to 1982 with the founding of William Hellermann&rsquo;s Sound Art Foundation, which organized an early show of sound sculpture and other work at the Sculpture Center (NYC) in 1983. Around the turn of the 21st century, many more high profile exhibitions of sound art were mounted with varying curatorial approaches serving to further broaden the use of the term.

A king returning from war finds his adulterous wife in a murdering mood, and before long he is dead. A wife betrayed by her philandering husband slaughters her two children as revenge. Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus&rsquo;s Agamemnon and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle&rsquo;s, Hegel&rsquo;s, and George Steiner&rsquo;s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan&rsquo;s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world. Possible topics range from online communities of mourning or the debate over how to commemorate the attacks and their consequences to the continuing influence of classical tragedy on contemporary culture in The Wire or Lars von Trier&rsquo;s Melancholia.</p>",

In this&nbsp;<em>First-Year Writing Seminar,</em>&nbsp;we challenge that assumption. Taking contemporary popular culture as a point of departure, we delve into debates from history, sociology, and literary studies in order to understand the social construction of taste, giving special attention to the complex role that &ldquo;good taste&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad taste&rdquo; can play in perpetuating social hierarchies.&nbsp; You will have the opportunity to further develop your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills while examining how ideas about &ldquo;taste&rdquo; are constructed, interrelated, and how they can inform, limit, or inspire the way we see ourselves in our social worlds. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Like all First Year Writing Seminars, this class asks students to write 3 essays of increasing complexity (in draft and final form) over the course of the term, culminating in a research paper and oral presentation.We begin by working on the art of close reading by analyzing the role of taste in a work of art or a cultural practice.&nbsp; The first brief essay will analyze such a text, making an argument about its embedded ideas regarding taste. Then, we consider key 20th century theories regarding the social construction of taste. In the second paper students will reckon with a theory of their choice by making an argument about its limits and/or enduring legitimacy by applying it to a specific visual text (a film or ad campaign).&nbsp; Finally, for the 3rd paper, students conduct original research on an independently designed topic, investigating &ldquo;taste&rdquo; in a case study of their choosing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this Writing Seminar will revisit some of the contemporary debates about the history, society, and culture of Islam. We begin by grappling with contesting representations of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; by Bernard Lewis, Edward Said, Robert Spencer and Samuel Huntington. We then delve into some of prominent sites of conflict and tension brought to the fore by such events as the Charlie Hebdo affair and the Burka controversy as well as the rise in Islamophobia in Europe. For the research paper, students will focus on the role of struggle and conflict in &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. Possible topics will revolve around issues of extremism, radicalization, and terrorism. Finally, students will deliver a short presentation on a recent ongoing debate of Islam.</p>",

How does a beautiful painting or song make us cry? Art flourishes in a world of opposites and contradictions. Art is reflective and provocative, reactionary and thoughtful, private and public. As one of our oldest methods of documenting what we see, it also reconfigures and transforms what we imagine. This freshman writing seminar will serve as an introduction to these tensions, and the social, political and material roles that art plays in our life. It will familiarize you with academic writing, and further develop your critical reading, thinking and writing skills. It will draw from a range of art forms that explore both current social issues, and more enduring questions.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Still others remain skeptical that the shari&lsquo;a was ever meant to be universal. &nbsp;Without answering the question of whether it is, was, or should be &ldquo;universal,&rdquo; this writing course investigates the debates that the question has inspired. &nbsp;How do different writers perceive the universality of shari&lsquo;a? &nbsp; What are the political, ethical, or other stakes of arguments about shari&lsquo;a&rsquo;s universality? &nbsp;Readings connect theoretical approaches to individual case studies in milieus as diverse as shari&lsquo;a courts in Ottoman Turkey, fatwa councils in contemporary Egypt, and divorce proceedings in Iran. Through creative and critical writing assignments, students explore the contexts, motives, and forms of evidence brought to bear by authors who contribute to ongoing debates about the ways we understand shari&lsquo;a today.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

In this writing seminar we will discover why outsiders are essential, and how they can be just as dangerous. The figure of &ldquo;the outsider&rdquo; is often clueless &ndash;or in over his head &ndash; &nbsp;or ignorant. But ignorance can be liberating, fostering open-mindedness and a chance to weave complexity back into dead narratives. Crucially, analyzing the role of the outsider across a range of texts and cultures will help us question the act of belonging. Biss&rsquo;s Notes From No Man&rsquo;s Land will aid in our investigation, as will essays by Binyavanga Wainaina and Suketu Mehta. In order to understand outsiders with adopted countries we will consider Katherine Boo&rsquo;s book about Mumbai&rsquo;s destitute, Behind the Beautiful Forevers. Since &ldquo;the outsider&rdquo; is sometimes seen as a master manipulator and exploiter, we will also watch documentaries by Mads Brugger and Joshua Oppenheimer to critique these claims.

What happens when we consider the process of writing a complex affective and neurological process? These are some of the questions we will be entertaining in this Writing Seminar.&nbsp; We will do so by studying not only how writers write but, more importantly, how writers make sense of both their writing and their process.</p>\n\n<p>It is seemingly the simplest of acts: sit down, get out a pen or put your fingers to the keyboard, and start transferring thought into written matter. However, the act of writing is a complex neurological, psychological, imaginative, and cultural practice. In this Writing Seminar we focus on writers and their expressive practice in an attempt to understand the process and material manifestation of writing. A fundamental tenet of the class is that writers and writing must be understood in their cultural and contextual complexities.</p>\n\n<p>In the first unit, we will focus our attention on short texts by writers on how and why they write. Readings may include texts by Charles Bukowski, Lydia Davis, Joan Didion, V. S. Naipul, Susan Sontag, and theoretical readings by Aristotle, Rousseau, Michel Foucault, Richard Miller, and Peter Elbow. In the second unit we engage writers&rsquo; memoirs, in particular Stephen King&rsquo;s <em>On Writing: a Memoir on the Craft</em>, Alice Weaver Flaherty&rsquo;s <em>The Midnight Disease: the Drive to Write, Writer&rsquo;s Block, and the Creative Brain</em> and Kazim Ali&rsquo;s <em>Bright Felon </em>in order to ask questions about writing as narrative praxis and sense-making. Finally, throughout the class, students will be asked to keep journals reflecting on their own practices. These auto-ethnographies will serve as the impetus for our third unit in which students will be asked to locate an area of inquiry based in their own practice and develop a small research project.</p>",

Though we tend to take it for granted (with the rise of selfies, SnapChat and Instagram for instance), photography promises us unprecedented intimacy and access to the images it captures. &nbsp;But is this intimacy merely a technical illusion? &nbsp;How do photographs alter the way we see and know the world? This FYWS explores these age-old questions, paradoxes born along with the birth of the medium.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Photography is more than its ubiquitous presence: photography furnishes us with potentially powerful insights into the recent past, into remote corners of the world, and into unfolding current events. Drawing on the work of Sontag, Barthes, Berger and others, this Writing Seminar analyzes not only the power of photography to shape and influence our consciousness but also its limitations in terms of how we come to &lsquo;know&rsquo; the world.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We begin first with the power of photography, particularly in the context of social documentary. How do documentary photos illuminate the fundamental tension between &lsquo;photography as art&rsquo; and &lsquo;photography as documentary&rsquo;? By reckoning with a range of sources that help shed light on the power that photography confers on us&mdash;both as creators and consumers of images&mdash;we lay the foundation to then delve into the ethics of a specific kind of seeing and knowing: what are the moral implications of intruding on and capturing pain, suffering, and death in photographs? &nbsp;And finally, having explored the ways in which photography creates the illusion of intimacy, proximity, &nbsp;and privileged &nbsp;access, we discuss the role of photography in representing social or cultural remoteness. By drawing upon Edward Said&rsquo;s orientalist framework, for example, we look at how representations of &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; help reinforce existing power structures and dominant narratives about &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo;.</p>",

This Writing Seminar invites students into a close and careful examination of the written, oral and visual representations of the American West in order to analyze and explore the mythologies that contribute to a national identity.</p>\n\n<p>These representations are often set against a backdrop of unimaginable physical beauty and natural wonder. Yet in them we also find unprecedented violence and racism. The social, political, and philosophical movements influencing Europe (among them colonialism, romanticism, capitalism, socialism, existentialism, and racism)<strong> </strong>followed the &ldquo;pioneers&rdquo; across the plains. This Writing Seminar will explore and analyze these tensions that seem to define the &ldquo;American character&rdquo;: the tribal versus the rugged individual, progress and our disregard for the natural world, tolerance and the intolerable, nostalgia for a vanishing landscape in the wake of unbridled development, law and order and frontier justice. These mythic tales about the promise of America continue to fascinate and frustrate. All of it-- the &lsquo;good the bad <em>and</em> the ugly&rsquo;-- have contributed to the representations of what it means to be &ldquo;American.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>To help us consider questions of genre, the course will consider<em> </em>stories and essays by American and Native American writers. We will begin with <em>The Sun&rsquo;s Myth</em>, a story in the oral tradition of the Kathlamet Chinook, and a Navajo Night Chant, <em>House Made of the Dawn, </em>translated by Washington Matthews<em> and </em>Dorothy Johnson.

Our discussions will be driven by the essential question: How is art similar to language and how is it different? The class will examine the form of the Petrarchan sonnet and Michelangelo&rsquo;s intention to use the sonnet form as a means of artistic expression. We will further explore how his sonnets are connected to the visual art he created. Upon observation of the artist&rsquo;s sculptures, instructors will facilitate discussion of the language used to respond to the visual expression as a strategy for understanding the world. In doing so, we will investigate the difference between of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; and &ldquo;viewing&rdquo; as a method of analysis. Students will identify the principal themes that connect all forms of his artistic expression, including commitment to artistic endeavors and psychological imprisonment.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nStudents will be given the opportunity to express a conceptual claim from the artist with a visual medium. Together we will explore whether the intentions of the artist can be conveyed more plausibly with words or through sculpture. Our discussion will address whether art is an imitation of words or a source of knowledge that can stand alone without words. What can be communicated without words? Does Michelangelo&rsquo;s writing serve as an inspiration for his sculpture or do his sculptures further ignite his writing?<br />\nDid the existence of an artist like Michelangelo keep a certain type of language or art alive and thus help others to see the world with new eyes?</p>\n\n<p><em style=\"line-height:1.6em\"><strong><strong style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Note: This course is only available to AEP/ESP students at NYUAD.</strong></strong></em><em style=\"line-height:1.6em\"><strong>&nbsp;This course does include a trip to Florence.</strong></em></p>",
