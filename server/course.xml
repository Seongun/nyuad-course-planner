Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.</p>

This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.</p>

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while Al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of Al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.</p>

This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711&ndash;1492 when various parts of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war.

We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.</p>

The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.</p>

Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists.

How have these zones been constituted naturally and historically, and how they are changing in the present era? Topics include the impacts of human settlement, especially on water resources, inter-regional and global trade, colonization, and urbanization. Finally, we will look at what governments and global institutions have done to address some problems emerging in these zones. Learning will take place through informal lectures, guided tours of key sites, activities such as walking, boating, and swimming to get an embodied sense for these zones, recording through sketching or photography, interviewing various people knowledgeable about the issues at hand, not to mention people affected by their changing surroundings. Daily diary writing is required, along with group discussions with instructors during the day, and a short final reflective paper.</p>

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies&mdash;including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet&mdash;are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.</p>

Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.</p>

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.</p>

Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.&nbsp;</p>

Our goal is twofold: to discover what was original in each, and to grasp how all were connected by a shared set of ideals and beliefs. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to the main cultural monuments of Florence, where we see (among other wonders) the palaces and churches that Alberti designed, the telescope through which Galileo spied the moons of Jupiter, and the tomb where Machiavelli lies.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="63" required="false"/><section term="January 2013" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="884"><meeting times="BD" days="T" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="ak3540">Anthony Kronman</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="AHC-AD 131J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>The Enlightenment and Its Institutions</title><description><![CDATA[<p>With astonishing speed&mdash;mere decades in the middle of the eighteenth century&mdash;Enlightenment not only transformed how we think about ourselves, through new concepts of individuality and community, liberty and verifiable truth, it also remade Britain&rsquo;s cities and institutions.

Florence has played a major role in these efforts and in the very idea of what modernity is. First, because Florence has remained intimately associated with the Renaissance, and thus with a literary, aesthetic, and scientific return to the Ancients. And second, because it is seen as a birthplace of modern political thought&mdash;especially republicanism and the theory of the state. In this class we will study the place of Florence in the modern imagination. We follow in the footsteps, both textual and actual, of thinkers who looked back to the past, and even at themselves, through the Florentine lens, and who asked what it means to be modern, to look to &ldquo;the ancients,&rdquo; and to look at the Renaissance as a cultural rebirth, by way of the city and its cultural heroes.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="63" required="false"/><section term="January 2014" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1381"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sg127">Stefanos N.

These towns also pioneered recognizably modern artistic, cultural, and engineering practices. Florence and Siena were especially vibrant in this transformation of urban life: the one a powerhouse of culture and industry, the other the Wall Street of Europe as it financed entrepreneurs, popes, and Europe&rsquo;s kings. Students will engage together in a three week project to figure out what made Florence and Siena tick. Students will come to know these cities intimately, visiting seats of government and Renaissance orphanages, climbing towers, exploring the home of a fifteenth-century merchant, and prowling a recently-excavated crypt under Siena&rsquo;s cathedral. Additionally students will also read and study the utopian (and dystopian) visions of these cities &ndash; Lorenzetti&rsquo;s frescoes of Good Government and Dante&rsquo;s Inferno -- along with diaries, letters, and constitutions. Students will hone their writing skills by reading travelogues of two of Italy&rsquo;s greatest story-tellers: Marco Polo and Italo Calvino.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="63" required="false"/><appears categoryID="41" required="false"/><section term="January 2015" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jt76">Jane Tylus</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2016" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00-12:00 pm" days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jt76">Jane Tylus</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2017" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4603"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jt76">Jane Tylus</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="AHC-AD 138J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Cinematic Imagination: Modernity, Media, and Music</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course examines modernity through the lens of artistic developments during the Weimar period (1918-1933), when Berlin became a vibrant cultural center in the aftermath of World War I. The emergence of German silent film at that time exerted a profound impact on traditional art forms, providing a new aesthetic principle for artistic production and reception. As a result, literature, theatre, painting, and music were reinvented according to a &ldquo;cinematic imagination.&rdquo; Engaging with Weimar cultural debates through the writings of artists and intellectuals who articulated the impact of film and photography on cultural developments, we will examine diverse artistic works and practices. Students, using video cameras, will explore the diverse urban landscapes of Berlin as a basis for a group <em>remake</em> of Walter Ruttman&rsquo;s 1927 film <em>Berlin: Symphony of a City. </em>As a reflection on the pace of modernization in Berlin during the 1920s, the film captures the metropolis through its shifting montage images. How can Berlin be understood as a symbol of urbanization today? What images of the city will emerge through our encounters? Finally, how can we understand the persistent power of visual media in shaping the global context today? The study of Weimar culture is interdisciplinary making it relevant to participants from diverse fields such as film, music, literature, art history, and history.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="63" required="false"/><appears categoryID="83" required="false"/><section term="January 2016" location="Berlin, Germany" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00am-12:00pm " days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="grb8">Gwyneth Bravo</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="AHC-AD 139" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Introduction to Digital Humanities</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course provides an introduction to the rapidly evolving interdisciplinary endeavor known as Digital Humanities.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 2 the student will work to perfect their command of Arabic syntax; will learn to produce longer argumentative pieces; will begin to access, assess and taste some of Arabic&rsquo;s key modern literary and cultural products and will continue to debate, and explore various aspects of Arabic culture.</p>

As a conversation-based course, inside and outside class activities focus on the communicative skills of listening and speaking. However, the skills of reading and writing are necessary as the text is written in Arabic. &nbsp;Class discussions will be vital and relevant to Arab cultural life, encouraging active engagement with the course and further exploration of the themes through folklore, song, films, art, etc. The focus of the course aims to develop the automated production skills necessary to function in an Arabic speaking environment. A core component of the course is the memorization and recitation of dialogues exemplifying basic grammatical patterns, vocabulary, cultural concepts, expressions and intonation patterns of Shami Arabic. Class activities include form-focused drills in addition to more communicative, open-ended activities in order to allow new skills to be practiced. Outside class activities include homestay, guest speakers from the Arab Shami community, field trips and many other forms of cultural exposures and interactions in the community that help learners enjoy an invaluable experience with both Shami dialect and culture, which provides students with valuable cultural and linguistic insight relevant to their own lives and inspire them to open their minds to new experiences and perspectives.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="51" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="3:35-4:50 pm" days="MWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="nmi2">Nasser Isleem</professor></meeting></section><prerequisite><title>Colloquial Arabic: Levantine Dialect 1</title></prerequisite></course><course peoplesoftID="ARTS-AD 400" isCapstone="true" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Capstone Research Project</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The capstone experience provides seniors with the opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor and to produce a senior thesis project.

What&rsquo;s the microbiome, and why should anyone care? How can human migration patterns in ancient times or the domestication of plants be understood? How can understanding the human genome influence knowledge about heritable diseases? Fueled largely by the Human Genome Project, modern biological science has entered a new, revolutionary era in the 21st century. Genomics and bioinformatics&mdash;the collection and analysis of vast amounts of sequence and functional data&mdash;are transforming how long-standing mysteries and new kinds of questions are solved. New scientific discoveries from genome sciences are impacting society, and every-day lives, on all levels: public policy, medicine, health, and the environment. This course introduces students to fundamental concepts and current topics in genome science.</p>

All these animals rely on specific mechanisms in their brains to endow them with these remarkable abilities. Understanding these mechanisms can provide deep insights into how all brains, including our own, are shaped by evolution to be fantastic problem solving machines. In this course we will explore the unique worlds of several animals, highlighting first the specific environmental problems that a particular animal must solve, and second, the amazing ways the brains of these animals implement imaginative solutions to these problems.

Through the lens of economics, students will learn to think systematically and strategically about critical management issues concerning consumer demand, costs, pricing, market competition, and organizational incentives. Lectures will be interspersed with games and case discussions to allow a more direct immersion in business situations.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="76" required="false"/><appears categoryID="150" required="false"/><section term="January 2017" location="New York City" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CADT-AD 1" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Multidisciplinary Artistic Collaborations</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Departing from the Wagnerian notion of <em>Gesamkunstwerk</em>, this course poses questions about the advantages/disadvantages/challenges of multidisciplinary collaboration in the production of new knowledge. Focusing on paradigmatic artistic collaborations in the 20th century and also considering the impact of digital technologies in promoting intricate collaboration between different domains, we will look critically at the differences and tensions between the Romantic ideal of the <em>genius, </em>an <em>Artist </em>who assumes almost the role of a demigod, and at the ways in which that notion was challenged in the 20th century by the appearance of artist collectives and movements engaging in collaborative multidisciplinary work. Moreover, we will consider ways in which these approaches were the key to solving certain complex problems: for example, the development of computational technologies such as GUI-based operating systems. Students will develop collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, robotics and telematics, which will be presented publicly by the end of the semester. The course will take place at the Innovation Studio, a place equipped with several sound, light and image technologies that facilitate this type of work to be developed. Whenever possible, guests will be brought to class to discuss their work in the framework of collaborative efforts. This will include visiting artists to the Arts Center who engage in collaborative projects. When appropriate, students will be required to attend the performances by these artists.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="165" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:40 - 11:55 am W 10:40 - 1:05 pm " days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="cag204">Carlos Guedes</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCEA-AD 1J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Prague, Capital of Europe</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Prague should have been destroyed during the Second World War, like other major cities in Europe, but somehow it wasn&rsquo;t. The remarkable survival&nbsp;of this exquisite city allows us to explore Central European history and culture in the context of a completely preserved inner urban core dating back to the Middle Ages. Drawing upon primary source readings, cartography, musical performances, art and architecture, the course illuminates the way crosscurrents of European culture became focused in Prague between 1400 and the present. In addition to academic encounters with such figures as Mucha, Kafka, Mozart, and Kundera, the course includes walking tours around Prague, trips to museums and concerts, excursions outside the city, and interactions with leading local performers and thinkers.</p>

In this colloquium, we will be reading a representative range of literary, political, and&nbsp;philosophical works from different cultures and chronological periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about death and immortality.&nbsp;So, for instance, we will examine arguments about the desirability of personal immortality from the perspective of both individuals and societies, and then gauge how&nbsp;these&nbsp;arguments might&nbsp;inflect our views about such things as recent innovative technological efforts to extend life and to ultimately achieve immortality--virtual or otherwise. By the&nbsp;same&nbsp;token, such goals raise larger political and societal questions about what sort of people we think there should be, how long they should live, and how many we&nbsp;think the planet (or the&nbsp;universe) can sustain. Students will be urged to confront such questions from a variety of moral, scientific, and cultural perspectives; to examine how views about death function in religion,&nbsp;in politics, in law, and in science; and to explore the role that death plays in the their own lives and in those of other peoples and societies.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40-3:55 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pm4">Phillip Mitsis</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 10" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Subjectivity</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Human beings differ from machines, and perhaps also from other animals, in the way we encounter the world&mdash;always from a first-personal perspective, an awareness of oneself in the world and not merely an acknowledgement of the world. But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, locating some particular function of the brain or &ldquo;neural correlate&rdquo;? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called &ldquo;the human condition&rdquo;? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any other single topic, have had something valuable to say? We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek, Christian and Jaina intellectual cultures, looking critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovsky; and at dissenters from William Hazlitt to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion&mdash;or, worse, a deceit.</p>

<p>Human beings are subjective animals, and it is the essence of being human to experience the world subjectively, from a particular first-personal point of view. To be subjective, in this sense, is not the same as being biased or partial, although aspects of human awareness like emotion, which traditionally have been seen as the source of bias, have an important part to play in making experience subjective. Indeed, it might well be that subjectivity is one of the great universals of humanity, that what it feels like to experience the world in a first-personal way is a shared,&nbsp;common, part of human experience, unlike the subject-relativity of taste, vision, and feeling. On the other hand, it might equally be that the nature of subjective experience varies, that what it is like to have a subjective take on the world is different in, for example, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism or Christendom. The aim of the course will be to go in search of answers to such riddles as this. We&rsquo;ll look both at the history of subjectivity and at the latest work at the cutting-edge of investigations into the problemmatic nature of subjectivity. We will examine the question of the relation between self and other as a social phenomenon and in the workplace.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15-2:30 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jg4379">Jonardon Ganeri</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 11" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>The Future of Medicine</title><description><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest challenges in Medicine is to prevent disease and ensure personalized treatment.

Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies with a decidedly multidisciplinary approach, and addresses their relevance to several &ldquo;global challenges&rdquo; of the Core Colloquia, namely Humanity, Equality, and Justice. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical and social-engineering projects, or the collusion of emotional and political regimes, the course further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. As part of this Core Colloquium, students are asked to think about emotions as global phenomena within networks of inter-cultural exchange, construction of meaning, and knowledge acquisition, as well as to develop Core Competencies in the areas of Structures of Thought and Society, and Cultural and Social Analysis.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40-3:55 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="am4117">Amir Minsky</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 13" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Colonialism and Postcolonialism</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Until very recently much of the world has lived under colonial rule.

Our inquiry is both global and firmly grounded in&nbsp;our experience as NYU students and faculty engaged with the United Arab&nbsp;Emirates&rsquo; broader community. In this course, we explore five fundamental questions about the ideal of just behavior and just institutions:</p>

<p><br />
1. What makes individual action just?<br />
2. Which solidarities, rights, and autonomy must a just polity protect?&nbsp;<br />
3. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? What sorts of liberties?<br />
4. What sort of justice are economic institutions bound to provide?&nbsp;<br />
5. What systems of global justice exist? What should their scope comprise?&nbsp;How can we work to approach global justice in our local institutions?</p>

<p><br />
We will approach these questions by examining answers to them provided by&nbsp;historical and contemporary theories of justice from Plato and the Prophet&nbsp;Muhammad (Peace be upon him) to Marx and Engels, Qutb, and Ambedkar. We&nbsp;conclude by discussing the challenges of global justice. Students will be required to use both qualitative and quantitative methods to understand, analyze, and&nbsp;communicate our learning about how we can approach ideals of justice in the&nbsp;context of local institutions. Throughout the course, we will engage in participatory&nbsp;action research to improve access to justice here in the UAE.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="reb11">Rachel Brule</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50-1:05 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="reb11">Rachel Brule</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 15Q" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Labor</title><description><![CDATA[<p>How has labor -- and our attitude towards it -- evolved from subsistence farming and slavery?

The expression of &ldquo;loss&rdquo; of human dignity in slave narratives, in modernist writers and artists, and the post-war appropriation of the term by international institutions and national bioethics commissions, have led to a conceptual confusion provoking a backlash from the scientific community that dignity is an incoherent, useless, and &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; notion. Dignity, a concept elaborated for its emancipatory potential by Giovanni Pico (16th c) and Immanuel Kant (18th c), has come to serve contrary political ends. A series of historical investigations into philosophical definitions, artistic (visual and literary) expressions, key official documents, and contemporary personal narratives, will lead the class to ask what if anything of this notion the contemporary period may recover or conserve for emancipatory practices in our evolving world system.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50-1:05 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="my16">Mahnaz Yousefzadeh</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="4:05-5:20 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="my16">Mahnaz Yousefzadeh</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 20" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Water</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Water is the life blood of existence.

Hammurabi&rsquo;s Code, 1760 BCE, is one of our oldest written records of nearly three hundred secular laws, and the Ten Commandments are both religious demands and a series of widely accepted moral and ethical standards. They are foundational in Islam, Judaism and Christianity. What do other religions have to say about how we regulate our lives? How do other societies challenge, structure and enforce their moral standards, separate and apart from religious doctrine? What place does our personal moral code have in the shadow of society&rsquo;s laws? Are all laws just? What role do the arts play in contesting the law, interpreting and reimagining it? &nbsp;Using a housing complex in 1980s Warsaw as the setting for ten short films &ndash; each based on one of the Commandments &ndash; writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski explores the nuances and relativity of ethics and morality. By examining up-close the ordinary dramas of everyday life, he leaves the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about the complexity of human morality and what constitutes right and wrong. In this course we examine each of Kieslowski&rsquo;s films in dialogue with literary and religious texts, ethical principles and precepts, and social, philosophical and theological criticism, to better understand what it means to obey the law.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50 - 1:35 W 11:50 - 1:05 pm" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js5887">Jim Savio</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 24Q" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Life in the Universe</title><description><![CDATA[<p>How did life form on Earth?

These differences of perception can generate inter-individual and cultural tensions and affect public policy, for example in the context of health care policy and equal opportunity in the work place. This course will examine how our understanding of human physiology, genetics, and development, as well as methods of investigations of human anatomy, have shaped the perception of the human body, through history and across cultures. The course will examine the function of the body and how the understanding of bodily functions has changed (the working body). The course will also delve into the modifications the human body has experienced evolutionarily and how our own body is changing from a single cell until death (the changing body). Finally, the course will examine deviations from the typical body plan and the causes for these deviations (the abnormal body). These topics will be explored using scientific and non-scientific literature, art pieces, and movies.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50-13:05 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sb5272">Stephane Boissinot</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 26" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Migration</title><description><![CDATA[<p>There are more migrants worldwide today than Brazil has inhabitants.

How has migration been represented in and shaped by literature and art? This course reviews exemplary texts, striking images, and important films. Focus is on the United States from around 1880 to World War II and on Europe in the second half of the twentieth century, then opening up toward students&rsquo; examination of cultural work by and about contemporary migrants from around the world. Readings include autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and creative visual work.

Today, an expansive network of inter-governmental institutions exists but global attempts at engaging with poor, conflict-affected countries often struggle to meet local needs. This course will examine global governance&rsquo; origin and logic, and its varying impact in local contexts. Through critical debate, students will explore different perspectives on global governance and develop a better understanding of how power, institutions and cultural norms shape interactions between global and local actors. Specifically, we will analyze successes and failures of international attempts at post-conflict peacebuilding in Namibia, Somalia and Afghanistan; 2) facilitating transitional justice in Liberia and Yugoslavia; and 3) addressing the refugee crises in Mozambique and Syria. The course will help students to grapple with the complex political and ethical dilemmas of global governance and devise more effective and context-sensitive strategies for resolving some of the most pressing challenges of our time.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50 - 1:05 pm " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mfh7">Michael Harsch</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 29" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Humanity and the Cosmos: Is There Room for Philosophy and Religion in a Scientific World?</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The development of science dealt a series of painful punctures to our perceived centrality in the universe, and in the process it upended many of the philosophical and theological doctrines grounded on that centrality. For example, the Copernican revolution &ndash; the discovery that the earth orbits the sun &ndash; led to radical changes in how humanity thought about its place in the universe, and these changes found expression in everything from science and philosophy to art and religion. More generally, scientific theories have gradually appropriated the explanatory domains once thought to be exclusive to philosophy and religion. Is there any role left, then, for philosophy and religion in a modern scientific world? How might reflection on this question allow us to better understand humanity&rsquo;s place in the universe? This course will investigate these questions through the lens of cosmology. The discipline of cosmology has revealed that our sun is a typical star out of billions in our galaxy, that our galaxy is one of billions in the observable universe, and it may be on the cusp of bringing about another revolution: &nbsp;that our entire observable universe is a tiny part of a vastly larger &ldquo;multiverse.&rdquo; What implications might this have for philosophy, religion, and our general understanding of ourselves as human beings? We will consider the intellectual history of cosmology and its 20th century transition into a modern scientific discipline, in addition to the contemporary frontiers of cosmological knowledge. What do we really know about the origin, fate, and large-scale structure of our universe? Given the likelihood that alien life exists, why haven&rsquo;t we encountered it? Are there reasons to think that the origins of the universe were &ldquo;fine-tuned&rdquo; for human existence, and does that create conceptual space for theological and philosophical considerations within modern cosmology? Should we even think that cosmology (and science more generally) is the appropriate tool for addressing existential questions about the nature of humanity?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="164" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mk161">Matthew Kleban</professor><professor netid="kjc405">Kevin Coffey</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CCOL-AD 3" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Indigeneity</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Indigeneity, n.

<p>This course explores the quality and concept of indigeneity as a force of history and nature.

We&nbsp;will also look at &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; ecologies currently threated by so-called invasive species, asking if notions of justice apply equally to the natural world, and if not what alternatives are available&nbsp;for protecting the non-human? Science, Social Science, and Culture converge in this class, in an inquiry into who or what came first, and why it matters &ndash; for culture, science, and&nbsp;justice &ndash; for where we go next.

With time, negligence, and even military conflict working to erase the past, we must ask: Can a better understanding of our shared heritage assist us in addressing cultural differences in the present day? And how can science both help us understand the historic record and work to preserve it? In this class we examine ways in which scientific methods can help define &quot;global heritage&quot; and protect it for future generations. For this purpose we explore the history and the science behind the creation of paintings, frescoes, parchments, sculptures, ancient mummies, historical buildings, musical instruments, and other artifacts.

In contrast to classical mechanics, which describes the interaction of energy and matter on large bodies, quantum mechanics focuses on the interactions of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic level. Hence, this course provides detailed insight into modern approaches that explain the structure and spectra of atoms and molecules. After completion of this course, students are able to understand the origins and meanings of key chemical concepts, including wave functions, atomic and molecular orbitals, energy levels, hybridization, atomic and molecular spectra, and electron spin. Students are also able to interpret various spectra&mdash;electronic, rotational, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance&mdash;and to correlate these to the structures of atoms and molecules.</p>

on &ldquo;embodiment&rdquo;) and to a number of technologies, from amplification to autotune. In the second half of the course, we focus in on the salience of voice<br />
within the experimental music scene in New York. Perhaps most importantly, we treat our class as an experimental vocal collective, composing and performing together throughout the term. No prior musical experience is necessary, but a willingness to make vocal sounds in public is required.</p>

<p>the portrait as a pivotal human artifact for artistic expression, private identity formation, and public self-fashioning. It traces a series of thematic issues central to the idea of the portrait through history in different cultures, media, and techniques. Themes to study are: image and likeness from antiquity to Facebook; the portrait as real and surrogate presence; portraiture and psychology; the &ldquo;face of power&rdquo;; portraits without a face; the work of art as self portrait; digital identity and the private portrait in the public domain; animal portraits and their owners; masks and casts; the unintended portrait; anthropomorphisms and readymades; the better self: face-lift and Photoshop; after life and afterlife.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2011" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2011-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2011-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="4:00-5:15" days="UW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sz42">Shamoon Zamir</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 03" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Instruments of World Cultures</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Musical instruments have been created by humans for at least 35,000 years.

The exile of Adam and Eve from the garden that God planted for the first man and filled with all the Earth&#39;s creatures and plants set their descendants on an infinite quest to find, describe, and recreate it. The course studies the efforts by people of the Abrahamic religions to specify the site, form, and meaning of the first Garden, in theology, literature, visual art, film, and garden design. It seeks convergences and differences among these interpretations across millennia and media, and ask whether the Garden of Eden continues to hold productive meanings today.

Taught by a collaborative artist, the course looks at&nbsp; collaboration as it has emerged from the recent history of art, literature, and science to become an essential method of contemporary social experience. Course projects and materials are based around the use of the iPad. Working with the device on creative, co-authored projects, students gain first-hand experience in considering how collaboration is structured and managed in the production of creative works and how a consideration of collaborative and interactive methods changes the way we think about the nature of the finished creative project.</p>

<p>The Core Competency Course &raquo;Men &amp; Machines&laquo; explores how technology has influenced our life, and investigates the use of machines by human and the influence of machines on human over the ages. The course further explores how technology has influenced the fields of arts and design, and investigates this inspirational source for new technological developments. Lecture and discussion will be the breeding ground for concept development of new machines: Every student will realise a prototype of a machine executing a certain task. There is no specification for the nature of the machine, the size of it, nor the tasks to be performed. The project will be complemented by lectures and case-studies, reading assignments (completed prior to class), class discussions and one-on-one meetings with the instructor. The course builds up the knowledge about futuristic developments and their use and influence from past to present, dealing with questions concerning ethics and values. &ldquo;Media arts&rdquo; and other concepts such as &ldquo;digital arts&rdquo; will be discussed as modern manifestations of the merging of technology with arts and media. Students will leave the course with a completed project to be displayed in an exhibition and a personal philosophy of about Art, Design and Technology.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="165" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2012" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2012-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2012-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:10-2:25" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="ae62">Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="8:15-9:30 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="ae62">Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:15 - 11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="ae62">Abdulmotaleb El Saddik</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00-11:40 AM; TR 11:50-1:05 PM" days="U" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="fhb2">Felix Hardmood Beck</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 17J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Nature of Code</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software?

Students read from books and journal articles, solve problems, listen to music, drum with their hands on their desks, learn how to use computer software systems to analyze as well as generate rhythms, solve puzzles of musical time patterns, and write on a variety of topics. They complete an individual research project that showcases the application of knowledge in their selected discipline and culture to an open question concerned with rhythm. They discuss progress on their projects during the term, and present their results to the class at the end of term.

Can creativity be learned? Because creativity is deeply personal, this course will address these questions through individual and collective experiences.&nbsp; The heart of this course is the Personal Creativity Project &ndash; an opportunity for students to actively practice creativity by designing and executing a project of their choice. The project may be on any topic, and previous projects have ranged from art and music to computer programs and business model development. The project will be complemented by reading assignments (completed prior to class), class discussions, and one-on-one meetings with the instructor. Over the course of the semester, students will develop a personal creativity philosophy, based on the fusion of readings, study, discussion, and experience. Students will leave the course with a completed project and a personal philosophy of creativity. The course provides a great deal of freedom for learning but does not provide step-by-step instructions. As a result, the successful completion of this course will require a significant amount of self-motivation.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="165" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2012" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2012-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2012-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:35-3:50" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dc125">Douglas Cook</professor></meeting><meeting times="W 3:30-6:00 (in CSE)" days="W" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dc125">Douglas Cook</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1480"><meeting times="2:00-4:30 pm; T 1:10-2:25 pm" days="R" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dc125">Douglas Cook</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2285"><meeting times="3:35 - 4:50 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dc125">Douglas Cook</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="3:35-4:50 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dc125">Douglas Cook</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3908"><meeting times="4:05-5:20 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dc125">Douglas Cook</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 28" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Fame</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Historian Leo Braudy notes that: &ldquo;the history of fame is also the history of the shifting definition of achievement in the social world.&rdquo; We will track early discourses of heroism and immortality from Alexander the Great to today&rsquo;s reality celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Beginning with concepts of fame in antiquity, we investigate Virgil&rsquo;s The Aeneid, The Bible, Homer's The Odyssey, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Richard III. The rise of contemporary stars across film, television, and theatre raises questions about the ways in which celebrities help manage historically conditioned categories of classification, such as gender, sexuality, race, class and nationality. Case studies of non-Western celebrities, highlight the formatting of modern stardom in Asia (Jackie Chan and Jet Li), Africa (Fela Kuti), and the Middle East (Umm Kulthum).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:10-2:25 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jk216">Jason King</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1481"><meeting times="2:35-3:50 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jk216">Jason King</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 29" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Performing Body in History</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This class examines the representation and theorization of the human body as evident in acting theory and performance practices.

Using examples from the performing arts, film and photography, we explore formal technologies of creating representations and cultural modes of interpreting them, and compare how reality is abstracted and codified by representations from different parts of the world. Some of the examples are films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Mother India, Xala and Al Za&rsquo;eem; plays such as The Road, Al-Malik huwa I-Malik, and St Joan; photographs by Annie Liebovitz, Brian Duffy and Yousef Karsh. Basic semiotic, materialist and reception theories will offer prisms for our study. Key essays such as <em>Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for the Pastness of India</em>&nbsp;by Dipesh Charkravorty, <em>Fictions of the Pose</em>&nbsp;by Harry Berger, <em>Imperialist Nostalgia</em>&nbsp;by Renato Rosaldo, and <em>Theorizing the Male Gaze</em>&nbsp;by Edward Snow are read side by side videos of performances, films and slides of photographs.</p>

Our questions include: Why do artists from a particular region privilege certain issues over others? What extenuating circumstances may influence an artist's practice? How do artists consider Identity through examination of place? What role does gender or gendered stereotypes play in the production of art? How do artists represent themselves in order to challenge gender or cultural stereotypes?</p>
<p> We explore several media and methods of self-representation in artistic practice.

To what extent do objects of perception look and sound the same across individuals, cultures, and means of representation? How much of music is a function of the way our auditory system works and how much is learned as a part of culture? This class approaches these questions by looking at the scientific literature (to understand the basics of perception), by examining cultural objects such as musical instruments, scales, and performances (for specific examples that bring the ideas into focus) and by contrasting the various technologies for storing and reproducing sound.</p>

Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist&rsquo;s oeuvre in relation to their personal life?

Internally, a person&rsquo;s individual memory content is overwritten each and every time something is remembered. Externally, memory is determined by social practices and, not least, our physical environment, shaping what may be called social or collective memory. The stability of the physical environment is a guarantor of an individual&rsquo;s memory and, by implication, identity, to a much greater extent than individual memory itself; it was as early as 2000 years ago that the nexus of the urban space and a stable memory was established (Cicero, Quintilian). The class will focus on theoretical concepts of memory in the fields of the arts, technology and invention in antiquity and the 20th century (Warburg, Halbwachs, Nora), discuss a novel that satirically memoriZes the fall of the Wall (Brussig) and provide numerous field trips that exemplify the concepts of social/collective memory based upon the urban space of Berlin (the replacement of the GDR Palace of the Republic by a reconstructed City Palace, Holocaust Memorial, Sinti and Roma Memorial, Jewish Museum, book burning memorial, Berlin Wall, Berlin Museums, the 3rd Reich Germania project).</p>

Pencils, glassware, and hammers are tools of this type. However, the definition of a tool can be expanded beyond material objects, to include things like storytelling and the internet. Tools can facilitate interpersonal interactions and enable intimate communication, yet have no physical manifestation. This course studies the invention and use of tools across cultures and time. We examine a large number of examples, starting with languages, moving through tools like the wheel and metalwork to modern tools like software and network topologies, asking how our choice of tools changes the way we think about our goals.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1354"><meeting times="1:10-2:25 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="shf220">Scott Fitzgerald</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1908"><meeting times="9:15-10:30 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="shf220">Scott Fitzgerald</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 40" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Records</title><description><![CDATA[<p>What drives us to create records of human events or experience? And how has that drive shaped not only the history of human communication but of record-keeping itself? What is the relationship between an event and the records or recordings we make of it? Is there tension between the promise of mimetic or documentary fidelity and new possibilities for art and imagination? When is the memorializing goal better served by invention than recording? This course will examine a series of technological innovations in record-keeping and record-making, from cuneiform to cassette culture, mp3s, and beyond. Readings will address histories and theories of orality and literacy, archives, print, photography, film, sound recording, and other media as we explore fundamental questions about memory, history, technology, and the relationship between art and life.</p>

It asks how stories engage us in prototypical, emotional human situations such as suffering, separation, loss, recognition and reunion. We will think about what aspects of our emotional responses are universal, what are culturally specific, what are gendered, what are individual and personal, and the similarities and differences between art emotions and actual emotions. We will draw on a wide range of artworks from a variety of periods and cultures as case studies, including visual and narrative representations of the Passion of Christ; canonical love stories, like Laila Majnun and Romeo and Juliet; classical and modern tragedy; romantic, popular, and program music; and comic art like The Comedy of Errors and silent film comedy.

<p>This course will explore the meaning of sound in the urban and natural environments within Abu Dhabi and the UAE. An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. &nbsp;The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.</p>

The sense of vision is closely related to processes of understanding, thought, and linguistic interpretation. Seeing is an activity in which the eye and brain work together, but the imagination also affects vision, for we sometimes imagine what we say we see. We will study the connection of image and language using the example of Hollis Frampton&rsquo;s film Nostalgia, which suggests that vision entails an aspect of imagining. We will approach questions about the nature of vision on the basis of texts, cinematic materials, art works, and experiments we conduct. The texts on which we will work include &ldquo;classical&rdquo; ones by authors such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, but also more recent theoretical approaches by Serge Daney, for example.

What can wood can teach us about ecology, human history, ingenuity and culture? By examining wood&#39;s role across several diverse cultures, this class will consider our ever evolving relationship to wood through its use in architecture, art and design. We will study the work of artists and designers including Richard Deacon, Koki Tanaka, Louise Bourgeois, Giuseppe Penone, Bill Reid, Charles and Ray Eames, El Anatsui, Henry Moore, and Ai Weiwei. We will also examine the lore and mythology of wood through literary works like the Epic of Gilgamesh, Hermann Hesse&rsquo;s Siddhartha, Shel Silverstein&rsquo;s The Giving Tree, Kenzaburō Ōe&rsquo;s Flaming Green Tree Trilogy, Betty Smith&rsquo;s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, the Enchanted Forests of the Brothers Grimm, J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings, and Michael Pollan&rsquo;s Botany of Desire. The class will include a practical studio component in which students learn historic and contemporary woodworking techniques, respond to carpentry design challenges, and develop a kinesthetic knowledge and materials understanding through the exploration and manipulation of wood and wood-based materials.

What is rejected or expelled from us? This fundamental aspect of the human condition underlies the notion of abjection: a detached, degraded state, or the act of causing it. The abject, renounced in oneself or cast out of society, takes various forms from the maternal body and the corpse to social minorities and refugees. It implies some trauma or taboo that disturbs the symbolic order of law and norms. This course asks how abjection occurs on many levels and also catalyzes new modes of life and community. We trace it in terms of love, beauty, horror, disgust, sexuality, labor, multiculturalism, terrorism, etc., and highlight today&rsquo;s abjection that is generated in global systems and revealed through violence or catastrophe, yet also with positive potential. We explore film (Fassbinder, Sissako, Campion, Eastwood, Von Trier, Sono Shion), literature (Sophocles, Boccaccio, Kafka, Yi Sang), art and performance (Bosch, Goya, Bacon, Sherman, Zhu Yu), along with psychoanalysis, feminism, philosophy, aesthetics, and trans-historical material from myths and religions to rock music and cyber culture.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3079"><meeting times="12:45-2:00 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="shj1">Seung-Hoon Jeong</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3911"><meeting times="2:40-3:55 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="shj1">Seung-Hoon Jeong</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 55" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Iconoclasm</title><description><![CDATA[<p>It is often said that as long as there has been art, there has been iconoclasm, literally from the Greek breaking (kl&acirc;n) of images (eikon). What does it mean to annihilate an image? What motivates the violent destruction of artworks, and what does this applied criticism, perhaps counter-intuitively, tell us about the fundamental impulse to create? Throughout history and across many societies&mdash; from biblical sources to Bamiyan buddhas, Reformation to the Danish cartoon controversy &mdash; reformers, idealists and revolutionaries have sought to silence dissent by erasing artworks that give potent material presence to ideas. Taking a long view of iconoclasm and censorship via case studies ranging from the ancient world to today&rsquo;s contemporary crises, we will investigate the power of the negated image or what happened when different technologies of picture-making &mdash; sculpture, architecture, painting, print, photograph, cartoon and video &mdash; clashed in the heated public square and pushed the politics of representation to its breaking point.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3448"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mmm26">Mia M.

What do gardens tell us about the human condition? How do gardens relate to the individual and the idea of community? How do they reflect philosophical ideas? In which ways do the real and imagined interfere with each other? Is a garden a representation of nature or culture or both? How does a garden relate to spiritual needs and sensual experience (smell, sound, sight, tactile and kinesthetic bodily feeling)? How is the idea of the garden distinguished from but related to the notion of a natural landscape? We will look at Zen-gardens and rooftop gardens, monastic and palace gardens, sculpture and pleasure gardens, mythic gardens in various religious traditions. The course is conceived as neither a historical survey nor typological compilation but chooses diverse examples of gardens and representations of gardens from various cultures and historical periods in order to reflect on the ways in which gardens reflect the human condition.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3143"><meeting times="3:35-4:50 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gs148">Gregor Stemmrich</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:25-11:40 AM " days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gs148">Gregor Stemmrich</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 57Q" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Touch</title><description><![CDATA[<p>It is easy to have an idea of the effects of significant loss of vision or hearing by closing our eyes or by wearing earplugs. What about a significant loss of the sense of touch? What would that be like? The answer might not come readily due in part to the subtle, effortless performance of the sense of touch. Far from being just an immediate skin sensation, touching is intimately blended into embodied experiences that are affectionate, expressive, personal and interpersonal. Indeed, the haptic modality is the fundamental mode of access to the physical properties of the world. This course provides a multidisciplinary, cross-cultural introduction to the dynamics and salience of the human sense of touch, and runs a continuous thread for a number of fundamental questions and critical approaches that twenty-first-century haptic scholars embrace. A wide variety of interpretations, disciplines and experiences exploring the symbolic, cultural, ethical, social and technical aspects of haptic communication will be discussed. Topics covered in this course include social and cultural development, memory, learning, digital design, experiences of visual impairment, tactile therapies, human computer interaction, multimodal interaction and sensory substitution, funneling illusion and apparent motion, and privacy and security.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="165" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3189"><meeting times="9:15-10:30 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mae8">Mohamed A.

Playing out over the millennia, from the Chinese tradition of the Lantern Festival at the Lunar New Year to the current production and manufacture of LED components, our relationship with light has played a significant role culturally and materially in our understanding of the world around us. This course will examine the perceptual, psychological, and metaphorical ways in which we encounter light in stories, art and culture. We will examine texts from a variety of cultures that use light and darkness as a metaphor for good and evil and study the works of artists like James Turrell, Anthony McCall, Teddy Lo and Erwin Redl who work directly with light. Celebrations, rituals, and ceremonial use of light like the Diwali and the growth and use of pyrotechnics will be considered. &nbsp;The class will include a practical component in which students develop their own light-based works leveraging the unique and innovative resources of Shanghai as a means of exploring the materiality of light firsthand.</p>

Some of the earliest known cave art, dating back approximately 40,000 years, is abstract. The use of abstract forms in ornament and for symbolic communication is found at different periods of history and in different locations across the globe. And abstraction has become prominent in modern art all over the world. This course takes a comparative approach to abstraction and asks why human beings in different places and at different times have drawn and carved similar shapes, lines and patterns and what are the meanings of these forms? Why have some cultures with long traditions of representational painting turned to abstraction? How have religious, political and social contexts shaped this turn? What has been the role of abstraction in Islamic and other non-Western traditions and how have these traditions influenced Western art? Although the course will range widely historically and culturally, it will take the Middle East as one of its key areas of interest and will include visits to galleries, private collections and selected centers for traditional arts in the UAE.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15-2:30 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sm5436">Salwa Mikdadi</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15 - 2:30 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sm5436">Salwa Mikdadi</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 61" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Water</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Water is the life blood of existence. Across time and place it has sustained society, nourished crops, made war, diffused networks of trade and cultural exchange, delimited political jurisdictions, and powered machines. Whether tranquil, in motion, or in modes of manipulation, water has also inspired many worlds of artistic practice. This course uses examples from the visual and performing arts to highlight the subject of water as element, energy, human right, bridge between cultures, and instrument of war.&nbsp;Films include <a href="http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/dout.html"><em>Drowned Out</em></a> by Arundhati Roy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JKs8aSb7eo"><em>Even the Rain</em></a> by Ic&iacute;ar Bolla&iacute;n, <em>Water</em> by Deepa Mehta, and<em> Black Water</em>.

But go to the emergency room and you&rsquo;ll be asked to rate your pain on a scale of one to ten; for the sake of relieving pain, you have to be able to measure it, to articulate its experience. In the absence of bodily injury, descriptions of physical pain are often deployed as metaphors for emotional pain&mdash;but can we really call them metaphors? Recent scientific studies on the physiological effects of &lsquo;heartbreak&rsquo;, for example, have suggested that the line may not be quite so clear. At the same time, in many religions forms of self-inflicted pain carry both a metaphorical connection to the suffering of a holy figure (Imam Hussein in Shia Islam or Jesus in Christianity) and also a real, physical experience. Ideas of empathy and sympathy and expressions such as &ldquo;I feel your pain&rdquo; likewise suggest that there is something communicable and infectious about pain, as it seems to pull apart traditional distinctions between mind and body, self and other.</p>

<p>This course focuses on the relationship between representations of pain and the way we respond to these: individually and collectively, culturally and medically, physically and emotionally. In particular, we will think about how artistic, religious, and popular representations of pain circulate and how they inform technologies and practices of pain relief, pain management and, in some cases, pain&rsquo;s deliberate infliction. We will engage with debates over the relationship between pleasure and pain, the ethics of &lsquo;witnessing&rsquo; without being able to stop the suffering of others, the aestheticization of pain, how race may shape our perceptions of others&#39; pain, and the involvement of medical professionals in practices of torture. Course readings will include philosophical treatises and scientific literature from a variety of cultural backgrounds and historical periods, as well as novels, poems, and plays.</p>

You can receive it from a priest in the confession box, from your friend or your neighbor, and lately it seems like something you hope to find at a bank. But if the latest round of &ldquo;debt forgiveness&rdquo; talks at the World Trade Organization are to have any meaning outside of international finance, it is time for a thorough review of the history of forgiveness. We&rsquo;ll track ancient ideas of forgiveness&mdash;think of it as the earliest form of jurisprudence: Hammurabi specifying an &ldquo;eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,&rdquo; or perhaps the limitless possibility of &ldquo;wiping the slate clean&rdquo; in the form of the jubilee&mdash;to the present, as contending theories of justice emerge and circulate in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.</p>

<p>Recognizing the special role of the arts in instigating, pursuing, and sometimes refusing attempts to forgive or seek forgiveness, the course will focus especially on the efforts of artists and performers to resolve, represent, or even perpetuate conflict. Students will probe specific case studies that were successful, or that failed in achieving a just peace, and the healing required to move beyond the horrors of war, long standing repression and violations of human rights. These may include: Apartheid South Africa, the Rwandan Genocide, the Slave Trade and the American Civil Rights movement, post WWII Germany, the Bosnian conflict, Canada and the First Nations, and others. At its most prosaic, this class asks: how do people who have let each other down continue to live together? When and why do they decide to fight, or to invent courts, or to write books, or to sing songs?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="3:35-4:50 pm" days="UMW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="ams51">Andrew Starner</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 64" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Human Value</title><description><![CDATA[<p>What is the value of a single human life? &nbsp;When a society honors a sports star more than a factory laborer, does that mean people with fame, wealth and beauty are inherently more valuable than others? &nbsp;This class will deconstruct the historical definition of &lsquo;human value&rsquo; across a diversity of cultures, from earliest recorded history through today&rsquo;s contemporary &lsquo;reality&rsquo; phenomenon of the Kardashians.&nbsp;<span style="line-height:1.6em">We will consider examples of human value in texts, films, biographies, visual arts, &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.6em">Internet, social networking, mass media and advertising. &nbsp;A practical component of &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.6em">the class will challenge students to explore concepts surrounding human value&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:1.6em">through a variety of artistic media. &nbsp;Students will learn the fundamentals of the </span><span style="line-height:1.6em">digital art including photography and filmmaking to produce both a Photo Roman </span><span style="line-height:1.6em">and a short digital film.

Whatever form an artist chooses for her/his writing (e.g. diary, essay, lecture, statement, open letter, magazine article, novel), we will approach the written text in relation to her/his art practice. The reason why artists not only make art objects but also write is generally that they feel they have something to say which nobody else (art critic or academic) would be able to say in their own language. This provokes the question: Do artists have a special way of thinking? How is their thinking connected to their art practice? Can we learn from artists to creatively interrelate experience and practical ambition as well as ways of thinking and writing? Artists&rsquo; writings provide a context for their work rather than an explanation. They open up new horizons for reflection on their works and on cultural situations. On the basis of a selection of texts from artists such as Lygia Clark, Yoshihara Jiro, Agnes Martin, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, and Andy Warhol we will observe how linguistic form and intellectual structure interfere, which strategies artists pursue to position themselves, and how the relationship between work and text is established. These theoretical studies will be accompanied by a practical task: learning from artists&rsquo; writings and experimenting with students&rsquo; own approach to writing in relation to their fields of study. On a regular basis seminar members will then discuss the texts each student produces in relation to the texts explored in class.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50 - 1:05 pm " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sp159">Sandra Peters</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREA-AD 66J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Art and Agency, 'Bild in Berlin'</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The course centers around the concept of &#39;Art and Agency,&#39; famously coined by the anthropologist Alfred Gell. The concept regards the idea that art works, pictorial images in general, and even objects at large, carry an agency factor, even possess an agency power that effects human beings &ndash; their mode of thinking, their emotions, their actions, their aesthetic experience etc. This concept has fundamentally impacted the way art theorists and art historians think about and analyze works of art. The course, offered at NYU&rsquo;s site in Berlin, introduces students to this fundamental concept, and brings it to bear with regard to three theories about the identity and workings of art that currently dominate the academic discourse on art and art history in, and beyond, Germany. Each of these theories, which in part are designed in response to one another, originates with a Berlin base university professor. Hans Belting, affiliated with Berlin&rsquo;s Free University, has introduced the concept of &lsquo;Bild-Anthropologie&rsquo; (&lsquo;Image Anthropology&rsquo;), which argues that there is a fundamental mirror-relationship between (material) images and the human body. &nbsp; &nbsp;The theoretical part will consist of morning sessions during which these &lsquo;Bild&rsquo;-theories will be discussed, also in the presence of some of their Berlin protagonists. The afternoon sessions will be devoted to in-situ analyses of individual &lsquo;Bilder&rsquo; in some of Berlin&rsquo;s most prominent museums: the &lsquo;Gem&auml;ldegalerie&rsquo; (Old Master painting); the &lsquo;Nationalgalerie&rsquo; (19th century art), the Bode Museum (Sculpture); the Kunstgewerbe Museum (Applied Arts), and the Museum for Prehistory and Early History. The museum visits are critically important for assessing the experiential value of these theories.<br />

Relevant research perspectives will include music theory and musicology; perception and cognition; neuroscience; and computational modeling. In particular we will explore how commonalities and differences of musicianship across cultures could surface those aspects of musical understanding that are innate and which are culturally conditioned.

Through the lens of particular cases we will tackle various questions: May we speak of a general fascist theory of culture and representation? &nbsp;How did fascist governments use aesthetics to respond to modernity, or to help create a modernism of their own? &nbsp;Was the concept of an avant-garde inimical to fascist culture, or useful to it? &nbsp;To what extent was there a movement of international anti-fascist resistance? &nbsp;How did it play out in art, architecture, or literature? &nbsp;May we even speak of a clean, absolute break between an aesthetics of fascism and that of anti-fascism? &nbsp;Did fascism die with World War Two? &nbsp;If not, how (and where) does it live on?<br />

<p>In this course, we attempt to answer the following question: &nbsp;What meanings do we make of human differences?&nbsp; More specifically, the idea of &ldquo;dis/Abilities&rdquo; in musical contexts provides a way of framing this societally far-reaching question.&nbsp; Our focus here is not just on musicians with disabilities.&nbsp; But rather, we are interested in a wide spectrum of human musical capabilities.&nbsp; Some scholars argue that our relationship to music&nbsp;is necessarily&nbsp;<em>embodied</em>.&nbsp; In other words, we bring a unique set of physical, sensory, cognitive, and affective capabilities into any musical situation.&nbsp; In this way of thinking, &ldquo;the body,&rdquo; with all its unique characteristics becomes an important consideration in our inquiry.&nbsp; In Western culture, people have a tendency to view musical ability on a continuum of &ldquo;musical prodigy&rdquo; to &ldquo;tone deaf.&rdquo; &nbsp;Of course, this bell-curve kind of thinking has its critics. Further into the semester, there will be a unit on Deaf musicians.&nbsp; Students will be exposed to a cultural view of music that remains largely out of sight of the hearing world.</p>

Lecture and discussion will be the breeding ground for concept development of the design of a bricolage: Every student will realise a product prototype of an Audio-Device. The project will be complemented by lectures and casestudies, reading assignments (completed prior to class), class discussions and one-on-one meetings with the instructor.

Since antiquity, humans have confronted physical immortality in song, literature, theater, and science. Indeed, the alchemists sought an elixir of life with curative powers that would prolong indefinitely the lives of those who consumed it. And even as alchemy gave way to chemistry, and science evolved into a modern discipline that focuses on understanding the natural world through strict rules of experimentation, the notion of immortality did not disappear. In fact, biologists often asked&mdash;and continue to ask&mdash;the related question: Why must we die? The results are often surprising. This course examines immortality and, by necessity, death, principally from the view of science, but also using literature and film. In doing so, fundamental human concerns are confronted&mdash;birth, growth, aging, sickness, and death&mdash;as the course explores immortality and the human desire to live forever.</p>

Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public&rsquo;s everyday experiences and intuition. Challenging that notion of inaccessibility, this course analyzes some of the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory.</p>

Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world&rsquo;s lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us the perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.<br />

When the gene was discovered and our ability to manipulate it became apparent, a whole new era in science began. Scientists wanted to understand the power that hides in the gene and the effects of its manipulation. The Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003 led to the identification of the genes in the Human DNA. This discovery is now leading the way to trying to understand the roles of those genes in our bodies, the diseases that may result from their malfunctioning, and consequently treating those diseases at the gene level. This growing field is known as Gene Therapy. In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy. This course travels through the world of genetics and examines the Human Genome Project, successful stories and challenges in the field of Gene Therapy, Genetically Modified Foods, and Cloning; all being topics that have fundamental implications on the society that will live in and contribute towards.</p>

From minimal visual cues, for instance, we can infer group memberships (e.g., sex and age), emotional states, personality traits, and even a person&rsquo;s intentions. The dexterity with which humans deduce such knowledge has fascinated ancient philosophers and contemporary thinkers alike. As a result, much thought has been dedicated towards a process that typically unfolds within less than a second. Based on this work, films, literary texts, and scientific evidence are presented to explore the perceptual, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that underlie common snap judgments in person evaluation. The accuracy of these judgments, their neural foundation, and the societal consequences of rapidly assessing others are discussed.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="46" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2012" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2012-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2012-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="8:30-9:45" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sq4">Susanne Quadflieg</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1094"><meeting times="8:15-9:30" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sq4">Susanne Quadflieg</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1915"><meeting times="9:15-10:30 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sq4">Susanne Quadflieg</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREI-AD 34" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>From Vision to Visual</title><description><![CDATA[<p>In 300 BC, Euclid first described Vision as the process by which rays traveled in a straight line from the eye to the object seen.

This course explores the development of optics and its influence on visual communication. How has our understanding of vision been communicated and changed over time? How successful have we been in &ldquo;visualizing&rdquo; the visual network that we are concurrently studying and trying to decipher? As we shed light on the visual code, we will highlight the importance of visualization tools in advancing scientific research.

The science of complexity, and goal of this course, concerns how to model such systems as connected networks so that we may understand better how the objects of disparate systems become self-organized, robust to disruption, and connected by links that increase in number/length according to common mathematical power laws. Topics for discussion are drawn from physical (e.g., geology, astronomy), biological (e.g., ecology, medicine), and social (e.g., economy, communications) systems. A consideration of the complexity of our own neural network, evincing conscious and unconscious benefits and hindrances to our behavior, will highlight an appreciation for the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon we call creativity, which characterizes our search for new unknowns in science.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="46" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1491"><meeting times="11:20-12:35 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="tgb3">Timothy Bromage</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREI-AD 40" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Idea of the Cell</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Proteins and organic compounds came together over three billion years ago to form the first cell.

These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco). &nbsp;The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic&#39;s scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health.</p>

Statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, the range of validity of models, approximations, data outliers, competing interpretations: scientists spend most of their time wrestling with these problems. Unfortunately, in classrooms and in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. If uncertainty is acknowledged, it is often portrayed as an argument between two groups of experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well established facts, and scientists occasionally have clear-cut divisions of opinion, more commonly they have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about the significance of a particular measurement or study. In this class, we familiarize ourselves with the language of probability and statistics, explore how it developed historically to become central to the scientific process, and how it is used by different scientific disciplines. We discuss how scientists express their ignorance, and how individuals and policy makers can still make judgments based on incomplete scientific knowledge. We also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs. Finally, we discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, we can still put limits on our uncertainty.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="46" required="false"/><appears categoryID="167" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1493"><meeting times="11:20-12:35 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="msr14">Mallory S.E.

But like languages, technologies or ideologies, numbers have a history, and understanding of them has changed over time and also been surprisingly controversial.&nbsp; Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers.&nbsp; Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality.&nbsp; Reading these authors will help us understand why even today&rsquo;s science has no definitive answer to the apparently simple question about its faithful servants: what is a number?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="46" required="false"/><appears categoryID="168" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1918"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jrp15">Jean-Renaud Pycke</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="12:45-2:00 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jrp15">Jean-Renaud Pycke</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:25-11:40 AM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jrp15">Jean-Renaud Pycke</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREI-AD 45W" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="true"><title>Progress in Science</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Science is a social enterprise, although one traditionally thought to be grounded in facts and reason. Scientists collaborate with each other, undermine one another, and compete for funding of research. Whether a scientific idea ever sees the light of day may depend on these distinctly social factors. So how much of what we call &lsquo;scientific progress&rsquo; is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates&mdash;the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? We&#39;ll examine this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. Our starting point will be Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, we&rsquo;ll consider why many scientific revolutions&nbsp;occurred in Europe and not elsewhere. Are some cultural and social features more hospitable than others to scientific inquiry?</p>

What sorts of considerations are used to assess and evaluate scientific theories, particularly when those theories upend our entire picture of the physical world and our place in it? Are there factors that go beyond the empirical data itself, such as broader conceptual and religious considerations? And are these &lsquo;extra-empirical&rsquo; considerations legitimate constraints on scientific inquiry? This course will examine these big questions about the nature of science in the context of Galileo&rsquo;s groundbreaking theory on the nature of motion&mdash;a theory that laid the groundwork for Newton and the rise of modern science. We will look at the many conflicts in which Galileo became embroiled&mdash;scientific, religious, and personal&mdash;and study the historical developments that eventually led to widespread acceptance of the Galilean worldview. Our aim will be to understand the complicated way in which Galileo&rsquo;s physics emerged, was resisted, and eventually triumphed, and to situate that evolution within a broader narrative about the nature of scientific development and change.</p>

Through these and other examples we will consider how and why mathematics is a subversive intellectual activity, relying on passion, imagination, and beauty as much as on logic and rigorous argumentation.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="46" required="false"/><appears categoryID="168" required="false"/><section term="Spring 1 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2296"><meeting times="9:15 - 11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mjb31">Michel Broue</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 1 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3455"><meeting times="9:15-11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mjb31">Michel Broue</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 1 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00 - 11:40 " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mjb31">Michel Broue</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREI-AD 55W" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="true"><title>Disease and Society</title><description><![CDATA[<p>How have diseases, and efforts to control them, shaped the nature and course of human societies?

But what is thinking, and how do thoughts form? &nbsp;People throughout history have come to very different answers to this question and have offered different metaphors for thought. The French Philosopher Descartes drew inspiration for his theories of the mind from mechanisms that were powered by pneumatics. Our modern understanding of thinking is shaped by the computer revolution. The class will discuss the underpinnings of the main fields of Psychology (e.g. Behaviorism, Freudian, Cognitive), as well as to how thinking has been viewed in a broader historical and multicultural context. We will explore how thoughts on thinking have shaped our understanding of who we are; and how our metaphors of thought have been inspired by technological developments and shaped by culture.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="46" required="false"/><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><appears categoryID="168" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3085"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="df96">Daryl Fougnie</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="3:35-4:50 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="df96">Daryl Fougnie</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="df96">Daryl Fougnie</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREI-AD 58" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Words</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Words, words, words.

In this course, we will read texts from history, literature, philosophy, and scientific sources, and discuss why we conceptualize the world in particular ways, whether any categories are fundamental, and the degree to which concepts and categories are innate or learned.

While these subjects are quite daunting, the course will pursue a conceptual approach that is accessible to students. Topics and questions will include: First, what does infinity really mean from the math point of view? This seemingly simple question is one of the deepest in math. The currently proposed answers all solve many problems but also lead to some non-intuitive consequences. Second, is there a unifying theme in mathematics? That is, is there a set of principles and a common language underlying all branches of mathematics? If so, would this set be complete? Consistent? Third, seeking a theory of everything in physics would unify all the forces of nature (electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces, and gravity) via combining quantum theory and general relativity. Is this a reasonable quest? Is it attainable? What would its consequences be? Fourth, to what extent are the above quests in math and physics related? Are unifying themes in one aspect of nature (e.g. physics) expected to reflect similar themes in another aspect (e.g. math)?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="46" required="false"/><appears categoryID="168" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50 - 1:05 pm " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="ha56">Hisham Ahmad Sati</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREI-AD 66" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Astronomy &amp; Cosmology: From Big Bang to Multiverse</title><description><![CDATA[<p>For thousands of years humans have studied the skies to help them grow crops, navigate the seas, and earn favor from their gods.

Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.</p>

They then produce disclosures at crucial moments of denouement. For Aristotle, this dynamic movement from ignorance to knowledge is essential, especially when it takes the form of the discovery&mdash;or recognition&mdash;of previously unknown identity. Tracing an arc from the ancient world to the present day, students study how the epistemology of modern storytelling across cultures disturbs the familiar patterns of clear and comforting revelation associated with classic genres. Readings include: Aristotle&rsquo;s Poetics; Oedipus Rex; the Odyssey; the Old Testament; the Gospels of Mark and John; the Qur&rsquo;an; the Arabian Nights; Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Lear; Naguib Mahfouz; and films from the 1940s to the present.</p>

Travel necessitates the creation of translations that reveal how knowledge of otherness necessarily involves comparison to home and self. Drawing on texts that represent travel in realistic, figurative, and fantastic terms, we explore the idea that a journey entails the discovery, not only of a destination, but also of the self. As Rilke wrote, &ldquo;There is only one journey. Going inside yourself.&rdquo;</p>

This course explores how imaginative writers have situated the human in relation to Earth&rsquo;s many landscapes, plants, climates, and species. How have they depicted meaningful encounters between humans and the other animals? What have they suggested about humans&rsquo; responsibilities to the countless other living beings with whom we share this planet? How have they &ldquo;mapped&rdquo; the slippery and shifting conceptual ground that lies between the &ldquo;man-made&rdquo; and the &ldquo;natural&rdquo;? And how might a renewed engagement with this vast theme help us deal with the heavy weather ahead?

If man, as Hannah Arendt famously put it, is <em>homo faber</em>, the &ldquo;creator,&rdquo; the tool-making animal, then from at least Plato to the present, human beings have been telling stories about how to use tools correctly and about how dangerous they can be. This course investigates the ways philosophical writing, novels, plays, and films have dramatized the vexed relationship between human beings and the technologies they create. What is at stake in the creation of tools and technologies? Why are human beings, perhaps now at the start of the twenty-first century more than ever, sp enamored with technological progress? Why is <em>technophilia</em>, the love of technology, so often accompanied by its opposite, <em>technophobia</em>, the fear of technology? What do the attitudes represented in the texts and films we are reading tell us about the dynamics of human agency and about the relationship between science and religion? Texts and films come from a variety of world cultures and include <em>Alif the Unseen</em>, <em>Arabian Nights</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>, <em>The Caves of Steel, Metropolis</em>, <em>Paradise Lost</em>, <em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>R.U.R.

How has illness literally and metaphorically participated in the reimagination of community, kinship, and sexuality in different times and places?

They have transformed human destiny since the beginning of time. They are rolling spaces of experimentation and exchange, &nbsp;hope and heartbreak, where peoples&rsquo; engagement with each other has unfolded, where humans have tussled with nature and interpreted the divine. Human interactions with oceans have spurred trade, set the boundaries of nations, built empires, redistributed populations, redefined tastes in food, produced new forms of art and music, transmitted diseases, and triggered new ideas and innovations in politics, law, science and technology. Above all, oceans continue to carry &ndash; and all too often thwart &ndash; the dreams of becoming and belonging of humans on the move. This course will explore the ways in which literary works across many genres &ndash; novels, plays, and poetry &ndash; have portrayed human relationships with oceans. It will prompt you to ask: how has the ocean functioned as a metaphor for the individual&rsquo;s connection with nature and society? In what ways do depictions of oceans commemorate or comment upon a panoply of human experiences through time? &nbsp;What affect and emotions do they encode?

And if so, what form might it take? A reenchantment as foreseen by religious cosmography, in which the human realm intersectswith that of jinn or other supernatural beings? Or might the discoveries and technologies of the modern world, including the laws of physics and breakthroughs in science, themselves be conceived as enchanting? This course looks at attempts from various cultural vantage points to reconcile magicand realism in the aftermath of secularism and modernity. Must enchantment survive only as an escape from reason? Or might it be compatiblewith the Enlightenment and scientific inquiry? We will look at responses to the riddle of magic in modern society in the art, theatre, film and fiction of Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.</p>

<p>Reading the body in terms of physiognomy used to be a respected field of (natural) philosophy as well as common practice from ancient times onwards and around the globe. A (pseudo-) Aristotelian treatise and Pliny&rsquo;s extensive writing on the subject in his Natural History, Chinese Tang-period perceptions, and Japanese/Korean scholarship (as documented in The Tale of Genji)&nbsp;give sufficient proof of the ubiquity of the subject&rsquo;s dignity. The course traces physiognomic patterns as a means to establish individual identity (e.g. Genji, Parzival) as well as otherness (e.g. Polo, Staden), starting with these texts and continuing through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It was only in the age of Enlightenment that severe criticism arose, branding physiognomy a pseudoscience and leaving only body language and facial expression as serious fields of empirical study. Modern cognitive science, however, has brought the subject back with a vengeance.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2012" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2012-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2012-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3366"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="wn7">Wolfgang Neuber</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 30" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Mortal and Immortal Questions</title><description><![CDATA[<p>We will read a wide-ranging selection of works from different cultures and chronological periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about what it means to be a human being faced with death. &nbsp; We will examine the attitudes and actions of characters struggling to understand the meaning of death and who must decide whether they believe that death is an evil that harms them or is something they should just ignore.

The formulation &lsquo;nation and narration&rsquo; envisages both the construction of the nation&nbsp;<em>as</em>&nbsp;narration and the imaginings of the nation&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;narrative (historical and literary). To capture a sense of the wide-ranging connections between nation and narration we track, through a variety of texts across cultures, periods and genres,&nbsp;the spread of the idea of the modern nation from Europe to the rest of the world; the struggles of anti-colonial nationalisms; the birth of postcolonial nation-states; their subsequent trials and tribulations; the rhetoric of nationalism; the critiques of nationalism; the voices of minorities, immigrants and indigenous peoples that disrupt a homogeneous &lsquo;national culture&rsquo;; the phenomena of transnationalism and globalization; and their implications for the future of the nation-state.

Sociologist Erving Goffman observed that stigma creates &ldquo;spoiled identities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Using ideas offered in Goffman&rsquo;s seminal text on stigma, anthropologist Mary Douglas&rsquo;s work on pollution and taboo, our readings will focus on authors who deconstruct experiences of stigma, and who write in order to destabilize, revise, and repair the personal and social damage stigmatizing categories and behaviors inflict.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="947"><meeting times="4:00-5:15 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dl782">Debra Levine</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 33" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Quest for Knowledge</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Humanity&rsquo;s need to make sense of itself and its place in the universe has generated the world&rsquo;s oldest creation stories and its most enduring myths.

In the past two centuries, millions have migrated from their homelands to work or find refuge in far-away countries with cultures very different from their own. How do human beings come to terms with such conditions and transformations in their lives? What are the cultural, emotional, and intellectual effects of being exiled from your place of birth? How far can loss be compensated for by the idea that something can also be gained? In this course we consider connections and differences between experiences of exile, diaspora, and migration by examining stories and writing about them in the Bible, the <em>Odyssey</em>, and texts by Plutarch, Ovid, Dante, Byron, Dostoevsky, Conrad, C&eacute;saire, Naipaul, Rhys, Lamming, Carpentier, Darwish, Edward Said, Julia Alvarez and Kiran Desai.</p>

Both genres are literary texts to which the&nbsp;distinction between an author and a narrator (the &ldquo;I&rdquo;) applies. Both genres concern themselves with a reflection of the self in contexts that vary across&nbsp;history and civilizations. They may be concerned with the development of the persona in terms of identity, religion, intellectual achievements, political&nbsp;conditions, etc. Autobiography differs from memoir in scope, the first being more comprehensive and pertaining to the development of the &ldquo;I&rdquo;, the latter concentrating on a crucial event in history as perceived by the &ldquo;I&rdquo;. The course traces the genres from the first documents in history to the present day, spanning a large variety of civilizations: from Greek and Roman antiquity, the Middle Ages in the Arab world, European, and Indian cultures, the Italian Renaissance and the Enlightenment on to examples from American, Indian, European, Japanese, Chinese, and Iranian authors.</p>

This course depicts the literary representation of pathologies and their medical treatments, ranging from eighteenth-century European treatises on the &ldquo;English Malady&rdquo; to the depiction of tuberculosis and leprosy in twentieth-century Japan. In the attempt to restore health, the relationship between patient and doctor is of central importance and therefore constitutes a thematic focus for this course.

Is this something conscious? Does it include the mind? Does it survive death? How exactly?&nbsp; Will it be judged, as Plato and Socrates thought and many religions suggest? We will explore these ideas from the Greeks through the Christians and Muslims, reading Homer, Plato, Augustine and Ibn Sina.&nbsp; The class will conclude with a glimpse at the late Renaissance, when the permanence and even presence of human souls became more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in the ancient and medieval worlds.&nbsp; In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way, whether to faith--or away from it.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><section term="Fall 1 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:15-11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="tg25">Thomas Gerety</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 42" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Animals</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Mankind&rsquo;s relationship to animals has always been ambivalent. Animals have been deified and demonised, petted and abused, cherished and exploited. While modern science is increasingly blurring the supposed demarcation line between animals (equalling nature) and humans (equalling reason), literature has allowed for transgressions that have worked both ways: transformations go from human to animal and vice versa. Not only this; throughout history animals have been thought to possess human qualities (and also: vice versa) such as speech and reason and have been represented to act in a way that often seems more human than the way humans behave. The class starts with the earliest literary document of mankind, The Epic of Gilgamesh, looks at texts from Antiquity and the Middle Ages from various civilisations (Aesopus, The Jataka Tales, The Panchatantra, Apuleius, Lucian, The Physiologus, The Journey to the West) and up to modern times (Darwin, Carroll, Kipling, Kafka, Dick) and also one film which especially reflects upon the strained relationship to an animal and man&rsquo;s self-perception in the face of nature (Moby Dick).</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1885"><meeting times="2:10-3:25 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="wn7">Wolfgang Neuber</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 43W" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="true"><title>Knowledge and Doubt</title><description><![CDATA[<p>We will explore the relation of knowledge and doubt in a wide variety of texts in different genres, historical periods, and cultural contexts.

Questions include:&nbsp; what sources of knowledge can we trust, if any? Are there ways to achieve knowledge by transcending our normal sensory and rational capacities?&nbsp; Might we be systematically deceived about the world and, if so, could we still find happiness in such a condition? Is our knowledge inevitably dependent on others or are our best sources of knowledge found within?&nbsp; How can our knowledge be distorted by strong emotions such as hatred or love?

Thus, they served supernatural powers as a vehicle for prophecy and premonition. Literature has made use of these specific qualities in order to reflect on the dreaming persons&rsquo; ethical motivations, impulses to act, finding their identity, being deluded or informed and changing their ways.

In the process, all cultures ponder individuals who do not fit definitions of the human&mdash;individuals who fall short or soar above their peers by commingling human with nonhuman ways and forms of being. Werewolves, wild men, fox women, and bird people test human nature against other natures. Sometimes these creatures find human nature lacking, and supplement the lack by reaching out into other natures; other times their transformations stage confrontations between civilization and chaos. We will survey how poets and narrative artists have imagined the commingling of humanity and non-humanity across several centuries and cultures. What are the attractions of getting beyond, or sinking below, the limits of the human? How do cultures set those limits? What resources does literature offer for thinking about self-definition in relation to social responsibility?</p>

We will start by charting cross-cultural debates over &ldquo;slave&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; through the ages, before proceeding to explore texts and images that positioned the &ldquo;slave&rdquo; as subject, and used literacy as a mode of resistance. How did these narratives define &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and shape international abolitionist publics? How might we read them for evidence of slave culture and community, and imaginaries of race, gender, and nation? &nbsp;How do novels and films serve as sites of public memory --or amnesia -- about slavery? What do they tell us about the threshold between history and literature? How does historical context serve to explain fiction? How do novelists and artists both use and challenge the archives to imagine &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in ways that official history writing does not accommodate?

How does disability intersect with other identity formations such as race, class, and gender? Ultimately, we will ask: what new forms of representation might bodily difference produce? Alongside texts that may describe disability as defective or tragic, we will trace other literary possibilities for bodies and minds that resist normative structures, from narratives that theorize ideas of access, cure, and care to fictions that reclaim disability as enlivening identity.

How have ideologies of gender been central to colonial and nationalist projects from the nineteenth century to the present? How does gender shift in the context of diaspora, migration, and globalization? We approach these questions through a consideration of aesthetic practices and representational forms &ndash; literature, film, visual art &ndash; &nbsp;that suggest alternatives to a binary logic of gender and instead articulate different visions of gender justice.

Why do humans feel compelled to tell, retell, edit, and contest stories about their darkest doings? What is more revealing of a society&#39;s values, the stories of its exemplary leaders, saints, and heroes, or the stories of its criminals, outcasts, and pariahs? What does the way a society judges and treats its criminals tell us about that society? For example, what does the death sentence passed on Socrates (for corrupting the youth with his philosophical ideas) tell us about classical Athens? How does Plato create a foundational myth of Western philosophy out of this criminal sentence? The intersections of literature, film and policing have fundamentally shaped the emergence and development of key concepts such as identity, identification, subject, writing, evidence, authorship, and authority. We will investigate these terms together with the ways crime and the criminal have been defined through time and in different cultures, using the lenses of literature, film, and visual culture. Works by Plato, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Franz Kafka, Lu Xun, Jorge Lois Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Herta M&uuml;ller, Fritz Lang, Akira Kurosawa, Jean-Luc Godard, and Abbas Kiarostami, among others.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="UMW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="cv26">Cristina Vatulescu</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50-1:05 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="4:05-5:20 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 57" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Optimism and Knowledge</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Is this the best of all possible worlds? &nbsp;Is this world knowable? &nbsp;The concept of &ldquo;optimism&rdquo; arose in the West at the intersection of these two questions. &nbsp;The European Enlightenment engaged the world as something that could and should be known because knowing could make it better. This optimism was a new attitude towards knowledge that does not dissolve into pessimism at the first sign of difficulty. &nbsp;We will take this history of optimism on the road with two primary stops. &nbsp;In China, we will engage what&rsquo;s been called the &ldquo;epistemological optimism&rdquo; of Xunzi and Confucius. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll then circle back to the Middle East to take advantage of Th.

The study of globalization further emphasizes detachment from the material world and privileges movement over locale. Consequently this emphasis on migration tends to position mobility and rootedness as opposite poles, often celebrating the former and neglecting or even devaluing the latter. The question is how a sense of place can persist in the face of all this movement and interaction.&nbsp; This course will consist of theoretical and fictional texts which make a case for revisiting the question of a global sense of place. How does the experience of displacement or contact with the outside change our relation to place? Is there a reaction to place that transcends nostalgia for lost origins?&nbsp; If displacement is valued over placement do the experiences of men predominate? The theoretical and fictional readings will center on the shaping force of place in human experience and the primacy of setting and landscape in narratives.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3125"><meeting times="12:45-2:00 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mjd10">Jean Michael Dash</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3191"><meeting times="3:35-4:50 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mjd10">Jean Michael Dash</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 59" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Unknown World</title><description><![CDATA[<p>For most of human history, anything beyond one&rsquo;s place of residence was unknown and mysterious, perhaps frightening and perilous, or perhaps hugely exciting.

Furthermore, how does secular confession operate in a globalized world? Do confessional practices traverse the globe? By broadening the Christian definition of confession and drawing on student generated material, we will examine confession from an intercultural point of view and think about what we can learn about a culture by the kind of secrets it keeps and the nature of its confessional practices.

We will read texts across eras, cultures, ethnicities, and genders that raise questions about the self and the collective, writing and memory, and about writing the remarkable as well as the everyday.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><appears categoryID="165" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="UTR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mw299">Marion Wrenn</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4205"><meeting times="10:25-11:40 AM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jkm9">Jill Magi</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 66" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Imagination, Inspiration, and Prophecy</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Do you have to be inspired to write? Does inspiration promise a divine message? Arewriters always drawing their ideas literally from &ldquo;out of this world&rdquo;? This course explores notions of inspiration and imagination specifically in the prophetic figure of the writer. From Homer to Malcolm X, Nietzsche to Muhammad, the figure of the prophet remains a necessary symbol of authority, because the prophet is a chosen bearer of the Word as Truth. This course explores the writer/prophet figure from the Odyssey to the Bible and the Qur&rsquo;an to modern philosophy and contemporary literature and film. It challenges us to examine what we expect of writers, the role they have played as transmitters, diviners, and revelators of &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; as well as their role as social and political critics today. It will focus on how writers look back at a time gone, while peering into the present and imagining the future through different genres of writing from epic to poetry to prophetic utterances. Texts include selections from William Blake, William Wordsworth, Mary Shelley, the Qur&rsquo;an, Karl Marx, Gibran Khalil Gibran, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, Toni Morrison and others. Contemporary reviews and short historical, critical, and theoretical readings will serve to supplement and provide context for primary texts.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:25-11:40 AM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mk5725">Maya Kesrouany</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 67" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Novels that Changed the World</title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Counts as&nbsp;Pathways of World Literature in previous Core</em></p>

<p>Books can transform lives, though too few novels make an impact beyond the personal or the literary. Once in a while, however, an extraordinary book may launch a revolution, alter national policy, divide a nation, or unite a continent. Why does this happen to some, but not others? This question seems especially pertinent since a novel is always a hopeful act towards a better world &mdash; in both its writing and its reading. This seminar examines the textual, literary, historical, and social circumstances that aligned to allow certain works of fiction to change the facts of our existence. The novel is a relatively young art form that began as entertainment, but its instructive empathy for other ways of being has created an invaluable conversation across borders and between eras. That is why novels are censored or celebrated, why they have been banned or become best-sellers, why they are used for propaganda or advocacy, and why they remain a vital part of the human experience. This seminar examines the social impact of such novels as Jose Rizal&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Touch Me Not</em>, Harriet Beecher Stowe&rsquo;s<em>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</em>, Upton Sinclair&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>The Jungle</em>, Chinua Achebe&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Things Fall Apart</em>, Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>The Satanic Verses</em>, Multatuli&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Max Havelaar</em>, Ding Ling&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River</em>, and more. Through such readings students will better understand their world through the stories that move people to action.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:25 - 11:40 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mas484">Miguel Syjuco</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 68" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Crisis and Creativity</title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Counts as&nbsp;Pathways of World Literature in previous Core</em></p>

<p>How is creativity shaped by place and how can it flourish under crisis? A number of cataclysmic events have afflicted the Arab world in recent years, yet filmmakers have persisted in their desire to tell their stories, against the odds, in creative acts that attest to their imagination, courage and resilience. While news reporting tends to present crisis in abstract, humanitarian or Orientalist terms, how do filmmakers build new perceptions, rather than merely confirming existing ones? This course reflects on these questions, together with the often-fraught relationship between art and politics. Starting with a critical interrogation of the terms &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;creativity,&rdquo; we will explore various creative strategies for depicting crisis in contemporary cinema. Although our main reference-point will be films from and about the Arab world, specifically, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, we will also build comparisons with films from Iran, Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Denmark, UK, USA, Spain, India and elsewhere. The course has no prerequisites.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="43" required="false"/><appears categoryID="83" required="false"/><appears categoryID="166" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4778"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 PM T 6:00 - 9:00pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sc6310">Shohini Chaudhuri</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="COREP-AD 7" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Ghosts: Constructing The Immaterial</title><description><![CDATA[<p>**Inactive**</p>

<p>The world seems to be pervaded by ghosts: the narratives of demons or devilish illusions and the spirits of the dead are omnipresent. Indeed all human civilizations appear to have constructed an immaterial world inhabited by spiritual beings and vapours. Consequently, one can find extensive narratives and visualisations of ghosts in word and image up to our present day. The course follows up a wide range of texts, pictures, and films from antiquity to the present day, including Homer, Plato, the Bible, Shakespeare, Hobbes, Kant, Thomas Mann, the Arabian Nights, the Tale of Genji, and various Chinese sources.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="47" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2011" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2011-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2011-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 02" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Wealth of Nations</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course examines the determinants of economic development in the modern world.

The second part of the course investigates the role of institutions, culture, religion, geography, and luck as deeper causes of comparative development. The main questions addressed throughout the course are: Why are there such large differences in income per capita across countries? Why have some countries developed steadily over the past 200 years while many others have not? Why do some governments adopt policies that promote economic development while others set up barriers to economic activity? These questions are analyzed from a theoretical and empirical perspective.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><appears categoryID="168" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2011" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2011-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2011-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:35-3:50" days="UW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mc3801">Mario Chacon</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="8:30-9:45 AM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mc3801">Mario Chacon</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:00-2:15 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mc3801">Mario Chacon</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1463"><meeting times="4:15-5:30 pm " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mc3801">Mario Chacon</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="12:45-2:00 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mc3801">Mario Chacon</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00-10:15 AM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mc3801">Mario Chacon</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 03" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Truth</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The course focuses on the concept of truth, addressing such central questions as whether there is such a thing as &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; truth; what truth is; why it is worth searching for; and how we can find it.

On the one hand, sexuality and gender have become objects of intense concern, politicized by religious movements around the world from the fundamentalist Christians in America to Islamists and pietists in the Islamic world. On the other hand, for large numbers of young people in the Western world not only has sexuality become increasingly unhinged from love, but love has become a troubling category, something uncertain and dangerous to believe in. This course examines the relation between love, sex, and religion as they reverberate in both the private and public spheres.</p>

We begin with a historical survey, from the &quot;traditional&quot; families that once dominated throughout the world, to the &quot;modern&quot; (industrial) and &quot;post-modern&quot; (post-industrial) family values that appear today. Then we focus on particular aspects of family life: childhood; dating and courtship; sex and reproduction; husband-wife relations; old age; female-headed and other non-traditional families.&nbsp;</p>

I represent myself as a living being, as belonging to a given society and culture, as having a given character, and so on. But do I have a representation of myself as the author of those representations? Exploring this question casts light on central questions of philosophy, for instance the relation between mind and body, the relation between self and other, or the belief that we have freedom of the will.

They allow for increased communication and creation. They are spaces for deliberation and collective action. This class explores the reasons why most humans now live in cities, why cities rise and decline, and how they become sites and stakes of political protest. We start by examining the politics of urban development in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and by analyzing three urban protests, in early 1990s Riyadh, in Cairo during the Egyptian revolution, and in New York City during the Occupy Wall Street movement. We then explore the concomitant processes of city making and politicization as analyzed by Plato, Ibn Khaldun, Hegel, Engels, Marx, Weber, Freud, and Simmel. The last part of the course is dedicated to interdisciplinary urban studies, from urban anthropology to the history of urban planning and to subaltern urbanism. In-class sessions are complemented by field visits to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="41" required="false"/><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="4:00-5:15 PM (Workshop); MW 4:00-5:15 PM" days="U" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pm97">Pascal Menoret</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1900"><meeting times="12:45-2:00 pm (Sem); U 2:10-3:25 pm (Wks)" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pm97">Pascal Menoret</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 16" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Family and Kinship</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Being part of a family and of being related, or kin, to other human beings is a universal human experience; it is fundamental to our sense of ourselves.

In addition, the course looks at the relevance of women&rsquo;s representation to address barriers to gender equality in the &lsquo;democratic process&rsquo; as well as the shortcomings of democratic mechanisms to achieve women&rsquo;s rights and some proposed solutions to these limitations.</p>

A gift can be a material object or money, but it can also be an act of kindness or love. A gift is free but it can also come with the expectation that it will be matched by a return gift. Gift giving is therefore part of a complex structure of economic and social exchange. This course considers gift giving from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and the arts; it explores gift exchange through ethnographies as well as texts on market economies and art, gender, death, altruism, risk, and the impacts of colonialism on traditional exchange societies.

We will use our insights to debate contemporary issues in property rights of interest to seminar participants. These might include intellectual property rights, rights to genetic material, inheritance, airwaves, financial regulation, the rights of indigenous tribes of the Amazon rainforest, claims on the Arctic, or the trade-off between rights to privacy and freedom of the press.</p>

To this day, individuals routinely sort themselves in to groups based on share political, social, religious, or cultural beliefs. In turn, these sorted groups often find themselves at polar extremes from one another, something that has often led to intense, and sometimes violent, conflict. In this course, we will explore the history, emergence, and pervasiveness of various kinds of polarization: ethnic, linguistic, religious, political, and geographic. We will begin the course by defining polarization and looking at examples of it from antiquity to the present. Thereafter, we will look at the consequences of polarization for politics, social interactions, and economics. The course will be taught using classical works by kings and statesmen (e.g., Constantine of Rome, Louis XIV of France, Woodrow Wilson), as well as contemporary scholarship from a diverse group of scholars: historians, demographers, political scientists, biologists, and economists. Special attention will be given to social media and social networking, a pervasive aspect of contemporary social polarization; it will serve as the basis for a course-long project.<br />

How do a series of sometimes disparate beliefs about issues come together to form an ideology? How do ideologies change and reform over time? In this course, we explore these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. We begin by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, we read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Robespierre, Burke, Jefferson, Marx, Lenin, Mosca, and (Benedict) Anderson. &nbsp;Thereafter, we look at how to<em> </em>measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter). In the last part of the course, we examine how shifting ideologies beliefs have (or might have) consequences for a wide range of human phenomena, ranging from interpersonal interactions to elections and international conflict.</p>

Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called &ldquo;the human condition&rdquo;? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any single other topic, have had something important to say. We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek and Jaina intellectual cultures, and look critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovskiy; and at dissenters from Vasubandhu to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion&mdash;or, worse, a deceit.</p>

Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical, and social-engineering projects, and the collusion of emotional and political regimes, it further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants, beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. Course readings include works by Homer, Aristotle, Dharmakīrti, Ibn Sina, Abelard and Heloise, Shigesuke, Descartes, Spinoza, Campe, Darwin, and Freud, as well as relevant secondary scholarship.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2266"><meeting times="2:10 - 3:25 pm" days="UTR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="am4117">Amir Minsky</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3195"><meeting times="12:45-2:00 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="am4117">Amir Minsky</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 51" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Shame and Guilt</title><description><![CDATA[<p>We will read and discuss works of major writers to explore the role that the moral emotions, shame and guilt, have played and still play, in our individual and collective lives.&nbsp; We will ask whether these two emotive forces are parallel or antagonistic in their effects on our behavior.&nbsp; We will apply the concepts of shame and guilt to the understanding of psychology and moral value systems, and of different patterns of culture and politics.&nbsp; We will attempt to understand how shame and guilt can both serve adaptive (life-supporting) as well as maladaptive (life-destroying) functions.&nbsp; Finally, we will ask whether developing the capacity to love can enable us to transcend the destructive outcomes that both shame and guilt, and the ethical systems they motivate, can generate.&nbsp; Authors studied will include Homer, Sophocles, the Bible, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Freud, Ruth Benedict, Pierre Bourdieu, Salman Rushdie and Kanan Makiya.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="12:45 - 2:00 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jfg7">James Gilligan</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 52" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Life's Ends</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The course will examine issues that arise concerning the concept(s) of life. &nbsp;It will particularly consider various attempts to say what the &lsquo;aim&rsquo; or &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; of life might be. &nbsp;Readings will be from a range of sources, philosophical, scientific, and literary. &nbsp;We begin with biological life (how to distinguish living from non-living entities; the &ldquo;units&rdquo; and &ldquo;levels&rdquo; of life). &nbsp;We then turn to a more &ldquo;biographical&rdquo; notion of life, applying especially to human lives. &nbsp;(Is there a natural or typical structure to &ldquo;a life&rdquo;? &nbsp;Is the unity of a life a matter of degree, and what does it depend on? &nbsp;Is narration the best way to describe or understand a life? ) &nbsp;Finally we turn to the value of life and lives. &nbsp;(Does all life have value, and by virtue of what? &nbsp;Does each human life have absolute value, or is it legitimate to compare and rank the values of different lives?) &nbsp;Readings will include works or extracts by Aristotle, Euripides, Whitman, Darwin, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Sartre, as well as religious texts such as The Bhagavad-Gita, the Diamond Sutra, and the Tao Te Ching.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><section term="Spring 1 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2272"><meeting times="2:10 - 4:50pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jr8">John Richardson</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 53J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>What is a Religion?</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Course description: Most English-speaking people can answer the question, &ldquo;What is your religion?&rdquo; &hellip; even if the answer is &ldquo;I am an atheist, so I don&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo; Yet the things we call religions are remarkably diverse. They differ, for example, in whether they address one God, no gods or many; how important they think explicit creeds are; how much attention they give to prayer, fasting and other rituals; and whether adherents are expected to dress or eat or engage in other everyday practices in a distinctive way. In this course we&rsquo;ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science&mdash;E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim. Among our questions will be, &ldquo;Is <em>religion</em> a European concept?&rdquo;</p>

Drawing on a wide range of sources (&shy;including academic research, historical documents, literature, film, and social media), the course explores how developments in the practice and technologies of surveillance have shaped the ways in which we think about privacy, identity, and personal information over the last 3000 years. Among the central questions that animate the course are: What is the relationship between surveillance and governance? &nbsp;How has the emergence of various forms of electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about identity and individual privacy? How do we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security in a world characterized by increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of state and private surveillance? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, paying particular attention to the ways in which certain major events (such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States) have shaped how we think about surveillance and its relationship to privacy, security, and democracy.</p>

To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: &quot;Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&quot; These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.</p>

Post-Colonialism</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Until very recently much of the world has lived under colonial rule. Major colonial powers shaped social, religious, and institutional life in countries that they controlled. This course explores the legacies of colonial rule. Do some colonial-era institutions and practices tend to persist into the present, while others are likely to disappear? What are the conditions under which persistence of institutions and practices is more likely? What does such persistence mean for the social, political, and economic well-being of former colonies today? We engage with these and related questions through the prism of related literatures in political science, economics, and history. First, we explore the motivations of colonizing powers and their methods. We then consider the colonial experience from the perspective of populations being colonized. Most of the course is dedicated to exploring the impact of colonial institutions and practices on contemporary levels of development, inequality, and conflict in the former colonies.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:10-3:25 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="lvp2">Leonid Peisakhin</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 61" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>The Body</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The body seems to be an essential part of our sense of individuality.

When barter systems do not satisfy needs, the ability to engage in such trades requires a peculiar sort of good, namely, money. In this course we begin with the theory of money, why one uses either barter, commodity or fiat monies, and the functions money serves. We trace the history of the development of money and credit across societies to the present day. We explore the centrality of money to various cultures and its representation in the arts. We discuss governmental manipulation of aggregate monetary stocks to spur or dampen trade; or historically to finance conflict by debasing the value represented by this peculiar good. We explore a central truth, that while modern money is intrinsically meaningless, its role in facilitating economic growth in the supply of real goods and services is surprisingly robust, provided policy does not deliver problems when too much money and credit is in circulation.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="cd86">Chetan Dave</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 63" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Internationalism</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Internationalism is as a way of looking at the world that seeks both to describe and prescribe the degree and nature of interconnectedness among states and peoples.&nbsp; Since the 18th century, a variety of thinkers have used the language of internationalism to promote different visions about the development of trade, governance, and culture across borders. This course will analyze how these diverse intellectual traditions have contributed to internationalist thinking.&nbsp; Five major questions will structure our discussion: 1. What is the relationship of internationalism to national and imperial imaginations? 2. Should internationalism be utopian, revolutionary, or reformist? 3.

What does it mean for kings, the people, or particular parties to be called &quot;sovereign&quot;? How is this sovereignty to be depicted? Through a series of literary, philosophical, and political readings in the Western, Islamic, and Chinese traditions, we will examine these questions, against the extraordinary backdrop of Berlin and its history as capital of the German Empire and of the Third Reich, then as divided city, and finally now as perhaps the most important political center in Europe.<br />

That is the question about the &ldquo;meaning of life.&rdquo; Though notoriously hard to make precise, the question has animated much literature, art, and philosophy. Some philosophers have provided disheartening answers: life is suffering, is absurd, is all about creating hell for each other. But others have provided more uplifting answers to support our quest for significance. Scrutinizing these answers should be of interest to anybody who wishes to reflect on &nbsp;her/his &nbsp;life &nbsp;as &nbsp;a &nbsp;whole &nbsp;as &nbsp;part &nbsp;of her/his education. After reviewing several pessimistic and more optimistic approaches to personal significance we turn to the subject of death. The class finishes with a discussion of a set of lectures on the topics of this course by a contemporary philosopher. This class is wide-ranging, but its main focus is on contributions in the current Anglo-American &nbsp;analytical tradition of philosophy. Do not expect answers of the sort &ldquo;The meaning of life is X.&rdquo; Short of that, there is much exciting material to be encountered that combines intellectual depth with valuable advice.<br />

As the world changes, questions of what appropriate moral conduct is naturally come into question. Yet some laws seem to have universal agreement across time and culture. Hammurabi&rsquo;s Code, 1760 BCE, is one of our oldest written records of nearly three hundred secular laws, and the Ten Commandments are both religious demands and a series of widely accepted moral and ethical standards. They are foundational in Islam, Judaism and Christianity. What do other religions have to say about how we regulate our lives? How do other societies challenge, structure and enforce their moral standards, separate and apart from religious doctrine? What place does our personal moral code have in the shadow of society&rsquo;s laws? Are all laws just? Using a housing complex in 1980s Warsaw as the setting for ten short films &ndash; each based on one of the Commandments &ndash; writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski explores the nuances and relativity of ethics and morality. By examining up-close the ordinary dramas of everyday life, he leaves the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about the complexity of human morality and what constitutes right and wrong. In this course we examine each of Kieslowski&rsquo;s films in dialogue with literary and religious texts, ethical principles and precepts, and social, philosophical and theological criticism, to better understand what it means to obey the law.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="48" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3708"><meeting times="10:40-12:15 pm;  U 2:10-3:25 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js5887">Jim Savio</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3709"><meeting times="3:35-5:10 pm; U 3:35-4:50 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js5887">Jim Savio</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="CORES-AD 78" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Why Is It So Hard To Do Good?</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Why is it so difficult to eliminate some of the greatest causes of human suffering&mdash;war, state-failure, poverty, and tyranny?

This course addresses fundamental questions related to desert climates and the species that populate them. What geographic conditions generate a desert terrain? How rapidly does the terrain change over time? What are the special attributes of the plants and animals that thrive in desert climates, and how do these populations change as the desert changes? This course uses the local terrain as a laboratory to address these questions, and team projects requiring field work form the core of the learning experience.</p>

Perhaps such fear is warranted since many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cancer, are caused by &ldquo;mutations&rdquo;, which are mere changes in the genetic information in DNA. Starting with basic concepts, this course explores important cellular macromolecules, such as DNA, and proteins as well as their threedimensional structures that endow them with their specific functions. In fact, understanding how mutations induce alterations to acromolecular structures often sheds light on the characteristic symptoms and prognoses of some human diseases and syndromes. Laboratory projects, which focus on introduction to computer modeling, emphasize visualizing in a three-dimensional environment the normal and altered macromolecules associated with some common but complex human maladies.</p>

This complex myriad can consist of microbes that are essential to a healthy life, as well as microbes that cause infectious diseases in plants and animals, which may also contribute to many chronic diseases and conditions, such as cancer and environmentally-related diseases. To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.</p>

Scientific measurements are used to discover traces left at the crime scene and connect them to a person, object, or place. But what is it about science that allows us to make these connections? And how are facts that are determined by scientific measurements different from those recorded during an interrogation? Does the word &lsquo;fact&rsquo; carry the same meaning in the legal system as it does to you? How about its meaning to an experienced scientist? In this course, students explore these questions while analyzing samples left at a crime scene using a combination of biological, chemical, and physical techniques used in forensics. We explore the underlying scientific principles and discuss how forensics relates to the criminal justice system and its impact on society. By analyzing adjudicated cases, both real and fictional, we also tease out the capabilities, limitations, and misuse of forensic science.<br />

In human history, causality was sometimes the province of the gods as in there is lightening because a god is throwing bolts at the earth. The introduction of Aristotelian logic permitted the development of deductive logic and the notion of consistency. Because deduction manipulates knowledge but does not add to it, natural science uses induction in which universal causal laws are believed because of experiments at a few times and places. This course begins with a discussion of the history of the arguments for causality, then it embarks on a detailed discussion of certain great experiments and the conclusions that resulted. In the process, we discuss how the progress of science determines what is accepted as a cause, from the &quot;taint&quot; of an ancestral line to the psychological impacts of childhood. Next, we discuss the inference of causality by machine. Students will work on projects involving the construction of experiments (either ones we have discussed or others), the discovery of the laws of a simulated world that the instructor has created, and then playing a game in that world.</p>

Biologists will tell you that the answer is induced embryonic stem cells, which can self-replicate and differentiate into all the cells in our bodies. What are stem cells? How are they &ldquo;made&rdquo; in laboratories? Can they make whole organs and organisms? Can we clone people? What are the ethical concerns when using stem cells? These questions are key to understand how stem cell-based therapies are likely to revolutionize the treatment of human disease. This class aims to provide a theoretical and practical background on stem cells. We will read and discuss the literature describing milestones in stem cell research and gain practical training in growing and differentiating embryonic stem cells.

His careful observations&nbsp;gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices, and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. We explore seven wonders of the invisible world&mdash; natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins and naturally occurring&nbsp;crystals.</p>

In astronomy, observation is nearly the only way to get data and test theories. For most of human history, astronomical observations were done using the human eye aided by simple instruments. The early telescopes were also aids to the human eye. It wasn&#39;t until photography was invented in the late 19th century that astronomy began to become independent of an individual observer&#39;s eyes. In this class, we will explore the development of our understanding of the Universe through the historical development of observational tools and techniques. We will start with the instruments of the ancients and progress to the modern era using data from today&#39;s most advanced observatories which are no longer limited to light our eyes can see. However, we are still limited almost exclusively to what the Universe chooses to show us through electromagnetic or other types of radiation, since even our deepest space probes have only barely left the solar system. This course will entail several observations at night.</p>

Often the most difficult parts of designing an algorithm are to make sure that when it is programmed in a computer, it runs as fast as possible and does what it was designed to do. This course covers the fundamentals of algorithms, focusing on designing efficient algorithms, proving their correctness, and analyzing their computational complexity. The algorithms studied are taken from a variety of applications such as robotics, artificial intelligence, searching, pattern recognition, machine learning, music, bioinformatics, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.</p>

Students learn about the principles and techniques used to construct large-scale networks and systems. Topics in this course include routing protocols, network congestion control, wireless networking, network security, and peer-to-peer systems. Upon completing this course students are able to initiate and critique research ideas, implement their own working systems, and evaluate such systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation. The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. Examples are drawn primarily from the internet.</p>

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.</p>

Students will study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers&mdash;firms and consumers&mdash;and coordinates their behavior. Students will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes.</p>

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in the United States, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in the United States. This course aims to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focusing on economic factors. The course will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. The course starts with the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next the course will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using &nbsp;knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, students will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights gained from studying the Argentinian experience will help the students understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="12" required="false"/><appears categoryID="75" required="false"/><section term="January 2015" location="Buenos Aires, Argentina" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2327"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mt3042">Mich Tvede</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="ECON-AD 221J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Understanding Financial Crises</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about financial crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises). Students will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long-run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, with emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once these foundations are in place, the course will open up on a series of topics with mixed themes&mdash;such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms&mdash;and an in-depth study of major crises episodes, such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007&ndash;2008 and the Euro Crisis. The classes will be complemented by visits to Washington, D.C. institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, The Petersen Institute for International Economics, and the World Bank, and by exchanges with officials who played a key role during past financial crises.</p>

Why 1.90 dollar a day? Where does this figure come from? How satisfactory is a definition of poverty that implies that there is practically no poor people today in the United States or Europe? Should poverty be measured with a pure monetary metric? &nbsp;How should be taken into account the subjective and social aspect of poverty? Alternative definitions often paint a much less optimistic landscape, with poverty diminishing much more slowly and in some cases not at all. More fundamentally, how is it the case that, even with the 1.90 USD a day definition, there still are countries today where about half the population is below that level and where economic progress hardly prevents the absolute number of poor people to grow? What are the obstacles these countries face in trying to &nbsp;access a higher, more satisfactory standard of living?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="75" required="false"/><section term="Spring 1 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4730"><meeting times=" 09:00 - 11:40 am " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="fb54">Francois Bourguignon</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="ECON-AD 225" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Financial Systems</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Recent global financial turbulence has demonstrated both how important the financial system is to the world economy and how complex it is.

Why are some countries so much richer than others? Will poor countries close the gap with rich countries? What is the driving force of growth in the long run? Are the benefits of growth equally shared between different social classes? How does government policy affect growth? How do the underlying characteristics of an economy -- such as its institutions, skill distribution, and demographic trends -- affect its growth rate?

Students will discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of these assumptions and provide explanations for them. Further, class discussion will include some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand.

Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="12" required="false"/><appears categoryID="75" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:55-11:10 AM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="rbm5">Rebecca Morton</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:35-3:50 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dsb12">David Blakeslee</professor></meeting></section><prerequisite><title>Intermediate Microeconomics</title></prerequisite></course><course peoplesoftID="ECON-AD 324J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Collective Welfare and Distributive Justice</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course explores the contribution of macroeconomic analysis to the normative issues surrounding the design of collective decision processes (voting rules, bargaining protocols), and the fair distribution and exploitation of scarce resources through prices or other market mechanisms. Attention is on the rigorous modeling of individual and collective welfare, and the logical difficulties of combining economic efficiency with the requirements of end-state and procedural justice. Applications include the Gini and other inequality indices, the Borda and Condorcet voting rules, the design of tax schedules, fair division of an inheritance, overcoming the tragedy of the commons, and more.</p>

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the &quot;vicious downward cycle&quot; caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="12" required="false"/><appears categoryID="75" required="false"/><appears categoryID="150" required="false"/><section term="January 2014" location="Berlin, Germany" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1374"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="rcs1">Roy Smith</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="ECON-AD 334X" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Islamic Economics &amp; Finance</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course provides a foundational understanding of the principles of Islamic economics and mode, products and procedures of Islamic finance.

Next students will examine how education fits into each of these strategies and the ways education may be used to disrupt peace building. The course will look at specific education initiatives such as peace education, Education for All, and citizenship education, but will focus on refugee education. Taking Syrian refugee education in Turkey as a case study, the course will visit Ankara, but will also briefly study Afghanistan, Guatemala, and the United States. Guest speakers will be invited from relevant organizations to speak about their day-to-day operations and their institutional roles.&nbsp;</p>

Although policy makers often regard education as a means to promote greater equality and opportunity, empirical evidence suggests that more often than not, a child&rsquo;s background predicts how well they will perform in school and what types of employment opportunities will be available to them later in life. However, some nations do a better job than others in using education to expand opportunity. Understanding why some nations continue to have schools that struggle in their efforts to serve minorities and the poor children, and why other nations are experiencing greater success in this endeavor is the central aim of this course. The course will also consider the ways in which teachers, students, parents and their allies, have used educational settings and the educational process as a focal point for resistance to social and cultural reproduction, and various forms of oppression and discrimination. The role of social identities related to class, race, language, and ethnicity in shaping the experiences of students and teachers in the reproduction process, will be a primary focus of the course readings and class discussions.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="139" required="false"/><appears categoryID="151" required="false"/><appears categoryID="127" required="false"/><section term="January 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2318"><meeting times="9:00 am-12:00 pm" days="UMTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pan6">Pedro Noguera</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="EDUC-AD 117J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Teaching the Nation: Education and Nationalism in Modern China</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course explores how China has developed and transmitted nationalism through a range of educational institutions: schools, universities, museums, stadiums, and mass media outlets.

Students are first introduced to the historical significance of experimental discoveries, the importance of experimental design and measurement. Key examples are discussed. The importance of measurements, errors, uncertainty and its justification will be discussed in detail and students will learn how to estimate, use and report uncertainties. Techniques to compare, analyze and report different measurements are studied. Students are introduced to error propagation rules, random and systematic errors and standard deviation as the uncertainty in a single measurement. The measurement system in an engineering context and practical examples of measurement systems and how they work will be discussed, as will be professional ethics within this context. Students will be introduced to the basic concepts in dynamic measurements, first order systems, rejection of data and Chauvenet&rsquo;s criterion.</p>

Operations on sinusoidal signals include addition of signals with the same frequency via the phasor addition rule, conversion between time-shift and phase, and addition of signals with different frequencies via the introduction of the frequency spectrum concept. Topics on discrete time systems include: FIR and IIR filtering, impulse response, causality, linearity, time invariance, and convolution. Time and frequency domain representations of systems and conversions between these representations are also studied. Z-transform domain, the concept of poles and zeros, stability and their relevance to the time and frequency domains are also covered. Topics on continuous time systems include continuous-time convolution, the Laplace transform, Fourier analysis for continuous-time signals, and the Sampling theorem..</p>

Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.</p>

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them. We shoot exercises in the classroom or on location.</p>

While focusing on the films themselves, the course also takes a cultural studies approach by seeing film as part of a broader artistic, political, and mediatic spectrum. Throughout, the course will be concerned with the revolution in film language wrought by Godard&rsquo;s jump cuts, Resnais&rsquo;s deliberate mis-edits, and Rouch&rsquo;s audacious cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;.</p>

The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory.

This course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. The course will include an examination of the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats to create singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. Students will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements, reflecting on how each form complements the other.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="14" required="false"/><appears categoryID="82" required="false"/><appears categoryID="83" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2109"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="arg391">Alexis Gambis</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="arg391">Alexis Gambis</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15-2:30" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="arg391">Alexis Gambis</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="FILMM-AD 301" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Advanced Filmmaking</title><description><![CDATA[<p>In this intensive course, Film and New Media&nbsp;majors will produce their Capstone short films.

Rigorous global history questions and even supplants common understandings of globalization as Westernization. But how does history do this, and can a global historical framework enhance all forms of historical, humanistic, and social scientific inquiry? Following an assessment of foundational modern Western frameworks for understanding world history, including those of Marx and Hegel, students examine how and why people around the world have variously embraced and rejected such foundational accounts. Readings address all world regions, including Asia, Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania, and familiarize students with state-of-the-art knowledge about globalization.</p>

This course offers a survey of the major theories and practices that have defined history as a scholarly discipline, and as a way of writing, over the last fifty years. Students are introduced to the major theoretical and narrative perspectives that have shaped historiography: to the kinds of historical questions that drive the research agendas of contemporary historians; and to the kinds of historical literature historians write, including analytical, narrative, scholarly, popular, and experimental. How do historians find and interpret their sources? How do they engage with existing scholarship while still striving to push their discipline forward? What methods do they apply to communicate the results of their research to other scholars and to a wider public readership? Students will learn to evaluate a wide array of different historical sources (including written documents, material artifacts, oral histories, and visual culture). They will also gain experience in meeting the challenges of writing their own works of historical scholarship, producing an original piece of written history by the end of the semester.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="91" required="true"/><section term="Spring 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:20-12:35 PM " days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="nr60">Nadine Roth</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:55-11:10" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="nr60">Nadine Roth</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1942"><meeting times="9:15-10:30 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="am4117">Amir Minsky</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2916"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="am4117">Amir Minsky</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00-10:15 AM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="nr60">Nadine Roth</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="HIST-AD 110" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Global Cold War</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The subject of this course is the Cold War as global conflict.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.</p>

This question, perhaps the most important question facing China (indeed the world) over the next few decades, pits economy and environment against one another. How did this adversarial relationship come about? Is it necessarily adversarial? Is it rooted in long-term trends in Chinese history, or in the most recent decades of double-digit economic growth? Are there solutions? Or are there better ways of asking the question? This course will look closely at the benefits, the consequence (pollution), and the costs of economic growth to society, ecology, and environment in China. The focus in on present dilemmas, examined through an historical perspective.</p>

By doing so, the course introduces students to a multiplicity of themes in African history, from the history of gender and sexuality to popular culture, generational conflicts, and the AIDS epidemics. Studying love is central to understanding how Africans have imagined and lived their lives as gendered individuals and members of their societies, often in the face of oppressive colonial regimes and strenuous living conditions. The course will view love in its various declensions: as an emotion and expression of intimacy (the notion of romantic love), as virtue (love in theological and political discourses), as a set practices at the chore of conjugality and sexuality, and as an object of debate in the public sphere. Students will learn how to historicize affects and their relationships to society, politics, and economy. We will read fiction and primary sources, watch movies, and discuss recent academic works that will help us understand change and continuities in how individuals and communities across Africa have defined, debated, and experienced love.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="17" required="false"/><appears categoryID="93" required="false"/><appears categoryID="95" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15-2:30 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pm1070">Pedro Monaville</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="HIST-AD 153" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Humanitarianism in Africa: A Critical History</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course is a critical exploration of humanitarian intervention projects in Africa from the abolition of the slave trade to #Kony2012.

During this period, Chile attracted the world&rsquo;s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies. This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile&rsquo;s social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile&rsquo;s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="93" required="false"/><appears categoryID="127" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2461"><meeting times="12:45 - 2:00 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mb5831">Martin Bowen-Silva</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="HIST-AD 173" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Central Asia and the Middle East</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course examines the interconnected histories, cultures, and societies of Central Asia and the Middle East.

The expansion of the modern economy over the past 200 years is unprecedented and awesome. Liberals, socialists, Marxists, Keynesians, and supply-siders alike recognized this capacity, and together they overturned the Malthusian propositions of old. They provided the &lsquo;toolkits&rsquo; into which we reach when we redress economic crisis and seek sustained improvement. We &lsquo;thought&rsquo; our way out of crisis after 1945 and 1973 in particular. The same world of economic thought places limits on our actions, partly because new orthodoxies have made certain options unthinkable, and partly because theory operates in a world of politics and unequal power. We will study thinkers such as Smith, Mill, Malthus, Marx, Keynes, and Friedman; New Dealers and the architects of the Marshall Plan; and the current debate over growth and austerity in the treaties that created the euro, the platforms of Podemos in Spain and SYRIZA in Greece, and the speeches of Sch&auml;uble and Merkel in Germany.

Our chief concern, however, will be the project of empire. How and why did the Romans come to possess such a vast empire? How did they perceive their realm? Why were they able to put this thing together? Furthermore, we will have one special concern in all of this. There was one geographical region, which the Romans tried repeatedly to conquer, and to hold. They never succeeded at this. That area is, roughly speaking, the modern Middle East. So, one of our chief questions will revolve around the fact that the Romans were so successful elsewhere, yet, for the most part, failed in their imperial project here. Can this be explained in terms of their imperial project writ large? There is, to my knowledge, no scholarly literature dealing with this question specifically, and as a whole. Therefore, we will get at the matter via a consideration of Roman expansionism, as this played itself out against the background of Roman history altogether.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="17" required="false"/><appears categoryID="96" required="false"/><appears categoryID="97" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mp8">Michael Peachin</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="HIST-AD 184" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>US Foreign Policy Since 1898</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course will explore the central events, issues, and ideas driving US foreign policy throughout the 20th century, starting with the Spanish-American War in 1898 and closing with the &ldquo;war on terror.&rdquo; The class will take an interdisciplinary approach and define &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; broadly, analyzing the country&rsquo;s ascent to become both an industrial and political global player by the end of the 19th century, its rise as an economic and financial power during the first half of the 20th century, its global military presence during and after World War II, its cultural diplomacy efforts and &lsquo;grassroots Americanization&rsquo; of USA popular culture and lifestyle, as well as its military and political conflicts abroad during and after the Cold War.

The first moment of legal study is that of inaugural texts and collections, of sovereignty, its representation and its textual delegation. The course will introduce the hierarchy of sources of law, the process of enacting law, the concepts of norm and rule, and then the plural regime of legal interpretation of sources, the hermeneutics of practice. Beginning with the concept of the Code, the course will proceed to the topics of Statutory interpretation, systems of Precedent, and forensic rhetoric in distinct substantive legal disciplines.

This course examines the ethical issues raised by the function of law and lawyers in protecting individual rights and advancing the common good. The course considers a variety of possible ethical theories such as natural law, positivism, idealism, utilitarianism, legal realism, interpretivism, deconstructionism, critical legal theory, and post-modernism as foundational to the rules governing the ethics and professional responsibility of lawyers. The increasing globalization and transnational practice of law warrants a comparative perspective on the similarities and differences between jurisdictions with regard to specific issues in legal ethics. Legal materials are drawn from a variety of jurisdictions, such as Australia, China, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States, in order to elucidate the relevant issues in legal ethics. Among the issues addressed are the legal profession and professional identity, trust, truth telling, confidentiality, conflict, client autonomy, access to legal services, cause lawyering, ethical breaches, and malpractice. In addressing these issues, the course involves lectures and class discussion of the readings. Additionally, the course also employs student participation in various ethical scenarios, and this methodology not only permits exploration of the facts and rules with regard to the ethical issues, but also assists students to develop skills that are essential to good lawyering such as client interviewing, negotiation, alternate dispute resolution, mediation, and reconciliation.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="171" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15-2:30 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pm4">Phillip Mitsis</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="LAW-AD 118" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Business Law</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The law has become a central subject in the world of business, setting the rules and regulations under which economies operate.

In a noticeably short time span, climate change has become a global challenge calling for collective action. Climate change law is emerging as a new legal discipline. Students in this course will explore how climate change law relates to other areas of law and how climate change has elicited rulemaking process at the international, regional, national and local levels. The course will encourage students to identify the climate change policy issues in state and international laws. Students will also study how international law and international relations influence current national laws and policies. The class will be invited to study the negotiation process, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun and Durban Agreements. The class will then proceed to evaluate the various legal tools that are available at national and international level to address climate change, including cap-and-trade, carbon taxation, command-and-control regulation, litigation, securities disclosures, and voluntary actions. The class will also examine energy and climate change nexus and the roles of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and carbon capture and sequestration. The course will pay special attention to the role of developing countries in the emerging international climate change regime and negotiation strategies of G77+China in Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Doha, Warsaw, and upcoming UNFCCC conference in Peru in December 2014.</p>

We will thus examine, on the one hand, the extent to which literary texts can help lawyers understand a larger human dimension that can revitalize their grasp of the ethical nuances of law. On the other, we will test Dworkin&rsquo;s claim that we can improve our understanding of the nature of law by comparing legal interpretation with modes of interpretation in other fields of knowledge, particularly literature. Readings include works by Aeschylus, Barthes, Brecht, Capote, Dostoevsky, Durrenmatt, Fuller, Glaspell, Holmes, Jackson, Kafka, Kleist, Marquez, Melville, Shakespeare, and Sophocles.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="172" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4520"><meeting times="11:50-1:05 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sk1392">Sophia Kalantzakos</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="LAW-AD 222" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Speech, Debate and Oral Argmentation</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Students attend weekly debate sessions of two hours duration (Mondays 7-8:30 pm) which focus on the analysis of current public policy and legal issues.

The study of substantive law begins with the division, inaugurated in classical Rome, between persons, actions and things. Law operates either in personam, or in rem, through the person or the thing. The study of law thus begins with the concept of subjective right and the law of persons, the framework of citizenship and the definition of the Constitution. Public law, the separation of powers, the legal framework of criminal law and other regulatory domains, and particularly the administration of justice, and the professional responsibility of lawyers, fall within this classification. The domain of private law divides into the basic disciplines of Contract, Tort, and Property. The links from these basic divisions to Commercial, Environmental, and Intellectual Property law will be tracked and framed.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="171" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15 - 2:30 PM " days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pg62">Peter Goodrich</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="LAW-AD 224J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Law in Entrepreneurship</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Law in Entrepreneurship seeks to prepare students for the interconnectedness of global startup organizations and the internal and external legal environments. The course will provide an introduction to entrepreneurial strategy with a focus on law as a basic framework. The course will provide students with the fundamental and practical knowledge of legal competitiveness for enterprises and will introduce students to a broad range of legal issues encountered by founders and business executives and will also help students develop a set of analytical perspectives for making judgments when such issues arise. Students will act in the roles of key decision-makers or their advisors and solve problems related to the development of the competitive advantage of the enterprise in a given market. While the chief concern of those who create and manage businesses of any kind is often in the mechanics of the business itself, law is an integral part of running the machine that is an enterprise. It is law that sets certain standards for the setting in which a business operates and provides the framework to codify the business&rsquo; own standards. Thus, insight into the law becomes a significant tool in the business leader&rsquo;s repertoire. It allows you to be mindful of the business&rsquo; limits and knowledgeable about in what manner the business can be strengthened.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="154" required="false"/><appears categoryID="172" required="false"/><section term="January 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:00-4:00 pm" days="UMTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section></course><course peoplesoftID="LEAD-AD 115J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Critical Issues in Social Entrepreneurship: Innovations in the Middle East</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Social Entrepreneurship is a dynamic and growing field that may be defined in various ways, yet at its core is about using evolved business thinking and practices to change the world.

Translation, and translation projects such as NYUAD&rsquo;s Library of Arabic Literature, play a pivotal role in shaping intercultural exchange and globalizing literary markets and canons. The course familiarizes students with practices and theories of translation from different literary traditions. Case studies include comparative examples drawn from distinct genres such as the epic, forms of lyric poetry, drama and modern prose fiction.</p>

Our course begins with the nuts and bolts&mdash;learning the tools, acquiring the skills, understanding the architecture of storytelling. Then, together, we build. We&rsquo;ll also play, debate, and experiment: discovering the line between news articles and fiction; creating characters using social media conventions; writing more vividly by unlocking our senses; declaring our manifestos; understanding publishing; examining censorship; and looking over the edge into the abyss with growing confidence. For writing should never be solitary: we&rsquo;ll learn from the works of published writers; more importantly, we&rsquo;ll learn from each other&mdash;not just how to write but why we write. And we&rsquo;ll stride forward with the fictionist&rsquo;s creativity, the journalist&rsquo;s rigor, and the critic&rsquo;s understanding. Fiction, and you, will never be the same.<br />

Twelfth-century geographer Al-Idrisi reports that eight Arabs sailed west from Lisbon to discover what lay beyond the &ldquo;Sea of Darkness&rdquo; (the Atlantic Ocean), and arrived somewhere in South America. Columbus reportedly had a copy of Al-Idrisi&rsquo;s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Students in this course will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of US American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. Students will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.</p>

This course offers a comparative, interdisciplinary approach to the plays of William Shakespeare, considering him both as an exemplar of Western literature and also as a world author whose influence can be felt throughout many cultures. We will approach the study of Shakespeare through three different sets of questions: 1) In what ways was Shakespeare a &ldquo;global&rdquo; author in his own day, adopting a &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; approach that transcends his English context? 2) How does the history of the publication, performance, and criticism of his plays transform &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; into a global cultural commodity? 3) What is the cultural legacy of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work throughout a variety of global media forms, including plays, films, novels, operas, and works of visual art? We will begin by looking at two plays, Othello and The Tempest, that have inspired adaptations in a variety of cultural contexts and genres. We will then devote a number of classes to investigating the global spread of Shakespeare&rsquo;s most famous play, Hamlet, from 1603 to the present. The course concludes with a creative project inspired by Shakespeare&rsquo;s lost play, Cardenio.</p>

Through this course students will examine poetic and prosaic texts, while revising their understanding of literary genres and categories, especially in relation to the tradition of Arabic literature. Students will also learn about the major approaches to the study of this literary tradition, while immersing themselves in its rich language, imagery and historical moment. Readings include selections from: Pre-Islamic heroic poetry; Umayyad love poetry; Abbasid courtly poetry and its influence on the Andalus; libertine poetry in all its registers from the early Abbasid to the Mamluke period. Prose literature will include the Qur&#39;an; Hadith; Apocrypha of the Prophets; picaresque maqāmāt; The Arabian Nights; and proto-novels from the 19th century.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="56" required="false"/><appears categoryID="97" required="false"/><appears categoryID="101" required="false"/><appears categoryID="160" required="false"/><appears categoryID="157" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3217"><meeting times="12:45-2:00 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="pfk1">Philip Kennedy</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="LITCW-AD 141" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Advanced Creative Writing: Documentary Forms</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course centers on the generative intersection of art and non-fiction: in other words, documentary forms. Documentaries are compelling because they are driven by a desire to investigate, educate, reveal. They often do this by claiming objectivity and reality rather than claiming subjectivity and fiction. During the semester students will therefore explore the relationship between aesthetics, ethics, and point of view in three mediums: poetry, film/video, and visual art, with an emphasis on poetry and text that pushes the boundaries of conventional prose and journalism.</p>

The reality of the people themselves and their daily lives is often very different. How do Middle Eastern writers represent themselves and their societies in literary fiction? How have they responded to the dramatic changes in the Middle East from the early twentieth century onwards? In this course, students will consider the continuities and diversities of North African and Middle Eastern cultures by reading a range of novels, with some poetry, written in the twentieth century, and the first decade of the twenty-first, as well as films, from or about Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine. How do novelists translate the dynamics of the changing historical situations of their different cultures into literary form? What literary traditions and models do they draw on? How far do these reflect the different movements and schools of belief in Islam, as well as the other religions of the Middle East? What kinds of more worldly and more personal representations emerge and how have these been changing over recent decades, particularly since the Arab Revolutions? How different are those novels written in English or French for a global audience from those written in Arabic? What are the effects of reading them in translation? Do the conventions of Western literary criticism work for literatures from other regions of the world? Students will be investigating these and many other related questions in the course of our investigations.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="56" required="false"/><appears categoryID="101" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4360"><meeting times="10:25-11:40" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="rjy2">Robert JC Young</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="LITCW-AD 144" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Reading Dramatic Literature: Authority and Imagination</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Dramatic literature from the Greeks to the present, including work from Asia, India, and Africa.

How was poetic creation different from other states such as madness or prophecy? How did medical, philosophical, legal and ethical discourses frame the questions of poetry and madness?&nbsp; Is the representation of poetic madness and inspiration in Arabo-Islamic discourse similiar or different from other traditions? This course will explore these themes (and others) in great detail through the intensive study of early Islamic poetry, Sufi mystics, *Maqāmāt*, *Arabian Nights*, Persian Romances,as well as numerous philosophical,ethical, and medical treatises.

What is the relationship of photography and memory in works of autobiography or of photography and witnessing in social documentary? In what form are such dialogues present in films?

The rise in interest in the postcolonial condition has been marked by a body of work that engages questions relating to empire and decolonization and creates new models for the analyses of power, identity, gender, resistance, nation and Diaspora. In this class, we will examine fiction, poetry, film, and political writings from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and their diasporic communities. Theoretical readings draw from Edward Said, Frantz Fanon, M. K. Gandhi and Ngugi wa Thiong&rsquo;o, while fictional and cinematic texts will include work by V. S.

Could we reconstruct our autobiography using only Facebook? Could we write a great novella by plundering our Twitter feed? Could we reframe the internet as the greatest poem ever written?

<p>Writing the City<br />
For the first time in history, more people live in cities than in villages. And they&#39;re writing about it. There&#39;s a global wave of books about cities, from Karachi to Cairo to Chicago. In this course, we will look at writers such as Dickens, Calvino, Jane Jacobs, Mahfouz, and others to see how best to write about the urban experience. We will examine the impact of climate change, inequality, and mass migration on global cities. We will consider issues of local politics, real-estate development, and urban planning, as they are reflected in official and unofficial narratives of city life.</p>

<p>Syjuco Advanced Creative Writing:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The novel may be the most demanding of literary forms to write, but to us readers it is also the most familiar. Perhaps that is why so many people long to write one. Requiring dedication, deep characterization, confidence with structure, a poetic relationship with prose, and an engaging story, a novel is definitely a huge undertaking &mdash; yet its familiarity makes it come surprisingly naturally. This course will offer the tools, guidance, and support to help you create the first draft of the book you&rsquo;ve always wanted to write. Just as people train together then run together in a marathon, we&rsquo;ll do the same &mdash; spending a semester discussing the art of the novel, doing exercises to prepare us, charting your course, then writing our way from beginning to the end.</p>

A displacement from one location to another in a two or three-dimensional space, and the quantity and direction of force applied to move an object are examples of vectors. This course studies the algebra of vector addition, subtraction, and the dot product and cross product multiplications, along with a thorough analysis of vector problems. The course further provides an in-depth study of trigonometric functions, trigonometric equations and trigonometric identities, including double angle and half angle formulas and their application. The concepts of rates of change, limits and derivatives are also discussed. Polar coordinates and parametric equations are introduced, and some basic properties of real and complex numbers are reviewed and several applications of the algebra of complex numbers are presented to illustrate how to use them in applications.</p>

This course explores the axiomatic method, some elements of logic and formal languages, and set theory. In addition, the system of real numbers and all other fundamental number systems can be firmly established on the ground of natural numbers; therefore, the course introduces elementary arithmetic and the universal method of constructing new objects from already known sets by means of equivalence relations.

The procedures used to summarize and describe the important characteristics of a set of measurements are studied. The course provides students with an overview of descriptive and inferential statistics, introducing at the same time some probability distributions that are useful in the applied sciences. Statistics is inherently applied; the course emphasizes solutions to problems in a variety of settings. Measures of location and variability, graphical summaries of data, discrete and continuous distributions, sampling and sampling distributions, hypothesis testing and estimation with confidence intervals, correlation and regression are explored. The course gives also a brief introduction to Bayesian estimation.</p>

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. The relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the Program in Mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus. Note: Although the topics covered in this Calculus are the same as those covered in Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111), Calculus places more emphasis on proofs, while Calculus with Applications places a relatively greater emphasis on examples and applications. Students who complete Calculus will be able to follow simple proofs and recognize different types of proofs, such as proofs by induction and proofs by contradiction.</p>

Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications.

Newton&rsquo;s equations of motion, the rate equations of chemical reactions, the currents flowing in electric circuits, all can be expressed as ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations usually evolve a combination of analytic and numerical methods.

In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. This course will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.</p>

By literally opening up common battery powered objects such as toys and finding their circuit boards, one can change the behavior of the object by interrupting the flow of electricity, creating novel, unexpected outcomes. This technique has both predictable and unpredictable outcomes, but it is almost always satisfying. In addition to hacking off-the-shelf toys, students will also build their own circuits with a minimum amount of components. Many of the projects in this course center on common integrated circuits, which we will cajole, trick, and abuse in order to create art.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="30" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00-10:15 AM; W 9:00-11:40 AM" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jf139">Jonny Farrow</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="MDMED-AD 118" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Alternate Realities</title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>This course will introduce students to the design and development of Virtual Reality experiences.

There is also the question of globalization&rsquo;s impact on the relation between cities and nations? More directly, have global cities outgrown their host nations? Is globalization a new iteration of the world economy, or is it more multi-faceted, with social, political, and cultural implications, including new dimensions of citizenship and social movements?

Public squares and parks, streets and esplanades&mdash;these are often the signature spaces that constitute a city&rsquo;s distinctive identity. They are also the settings of everyday life, mixing bowls where a city&rsquo;s diverse communities interact, forums for individual as well as collective action and expression. This course explores the nature of public space in cities around the world, with attention to their physical character and design, their history, their pictorial and literary representation, and the political and social practices that activate public space. We will explore three overarching questions. What do we mean by &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;public space&rdquo;? What are common characteristics of public spaces and how do people use them? And why are public spaces important to city life? In addition to historical and contemporary squares and streetscapes of Europe and the Middle East, we will draw upon case studies in Sydney as well as the hometowns of our students.</p>

Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.</p>

Whether conflicts are being waged in the name of national, ethnic, economic, or ideological concerns, it is clear that music and musical practices play a critical role in the complex sociological rituals of war, from the military marches accompanying deployment to the orchestral requiems that serve to memorialize the dead. Beginning with music in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I and II, the seminar also examines the period after 1945 with the birth and evolution of rock and roll, which played a critical role in the protest and peace movements of the 1960s, as well as in movements for civil rights and social justice at that time. Whether hearing John Lennon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Give Peace a Chance&rdquo; against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, or engaging with heavy metal music as an instrument of torture in Abu Ghraib in the context of the War on Terror, this seminar explores music as a contested social practice during times of conflict in order to raise fundamental ethical questions concerning our role and responsibility in the world today.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="19" required="false"/><appears categoryID="31" required="false"/><appears categoryID="111" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50-13:05 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="grb8">Gwyneth Bravo</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="MUSIC-AD 120" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Making Music</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This practical course endeavors to expose students to the various processes and tools by which music is creatively conceived and brought to public life.

Beginning with music in the myths and ancient histories of Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece, the seminar concludes with an examination of music and musical production within emerging global and transnational networks of power, where new technologies of mediation are radically re-orchestrating our engagement with sound and the world. Within the broad scope of this overview, we will examine the historical repertoire that has come to be known as &quot;classical music.&quot; The course explores the idea of a permanent canon of musical masterworks, which as a nineteenth-century invention, expanded gradually to include much earlier music as it became increasingly known. The course is not limited to the European musical tradition and canon but also examines non-Western musical traditions in the Middle East, India, and Asia, which grew out of a complex confluence of established practices.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="19" required="false"/><appears categoryID="108" required="true"/><appears categoryID="109" required="true"/><appears categoryID="114" required="true"/><section term="Fall 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2013-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1178"><meeting times="2:35-3:50" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="grb8">Gwyneth Bravo</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2972"><meeting times="10:40-11:55 am" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="grb8">Gwyneth Bravo</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50-1:05 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="grb8">Gwyneth Bravo</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="MUSIC-AD 162" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>African Popular Music</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course examines the historical foundations, sociocultural contexts, and formal characteristics of twentieth- and twenty-first-century African popular music, covering a range of genres from across the continent.

<p><em>As different as people are, so are the characteristics of a room as they related to sound. Almost everything can have an effect on the way things sound from one room to another. Materials, shapes of walls, angles, all play a part in the acoustics of rooms.</em></p>

<p><em>Musical Acoustic Course is designed to introduce the fundamentals of acoustics, with a focus on spaces designed for recording music and live performance.

<p>The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. &nbsp;The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).</p>

Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered "shared cultural heritage." Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed.

This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York&rsquo;s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="7" required="false"/><appears categoryID="60" required="false"/><appears categoryID="147" required="false"/><appears categoryID="155" required="false"/><section term="January 2013" location="New York City" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="855"><meeting times="9:00-11:00 am" days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section></course><course peoplesoftID="MUSST-AD 115" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>World Heritage Sites &amp; Universal Collections</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the theory and current academic debates on the subject of &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; cultural heritage from both a global and a local perspective.

These heritage sites serve a specific purpose as markers of individual and collective memories of a traumatic past. Because of the sensitivity of the subject and the complexity of the transnational stakeholder groups, these sites are often highly contested. In this course the creation of this type of heritage will be analyzed through the comparison of different heritage sites associated with human suffering that are now inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Robben Island in South Africa and Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland are still within the realm of living memories while slave castles in Ghana and slave dungeons on Zanzibar are not. What impact does distance in time and place have on this type of heritage? How does the practice of both remembering and forgetting affect the interpretation of these painful heritage sites? The students will study this practice by conducting field research at the slave castles in Ghana. Through interviews and observations they will explore the process of heritage production, the function of heritage, and the role of memory and identity.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="155" required="false"/><section term="January 2016" location="Accra, Ghana" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00 am-12:00 pm" days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="rp1768">Robert Parthesius</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="MUSST-AD 214JX" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes</title><description><![CDATA[<p>In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered &ldquo;shared cultural heritage&rdquo;. Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if &ldquo;universal values&rdquo; are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multivocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="49" required="false"/><appears categoryID="60" required="false"/><appears categoryID="147" required="false"/><appears categoryID="155" required="false"/><section term="January 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1627"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="rp1768">Robert Parthesius</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="MUSST-AD 215J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Museums in a Global Context</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Museums in a Global Context surveys the history and representational role of art museums, from their origins in cabinets of curiosity formed during the age of exploration to their global proliferation today.

Among the issues to be discussed are: the organization and display of art collections, the language and symbolism of museum architecture, the relationship of museums to their public(s), heritage and repatriation, cultural diversity and the politics of representation, and globalized collecting and exhibiting today.

The class will consider the motives behind&nbsp;conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of&nbsp;emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the&nbsp;rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of&nbsp;conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and&nbsp;conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological&nbsp;markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism,&nbsp;as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students&nbsp;will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace&nbsp;psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.</p>

In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what&nbsp;types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional&nbsp;justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly&nbsp;and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence.&nbsp;This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous&nbsp;options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and&nbsp;ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section&nbsp;introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the&nbsp;most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and&nbsp;reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international&nbsp;tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and&nbsp;Sierra Leone.</p>

Organizations such as the League of Nations and the<br />
UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s&nbsp;international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they<br />
provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons,&nbsp;convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in&nbsp;need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both&nbsp;global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and&nbsp;the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states&nbsp;cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs&nbsp;contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international&nbsp;system.</p>

Some philosophers have argued that if our actions are causally determined, then freedom of the will is impossible. Others have argued that freedom does not depend on the truth or falsity of causal determinism. Is free will possible in a world where every event is causally determined? Are there different kinds of freedom? If so, are all kinds of freedom equally worth having? Must we act freely in order to be responsible for our actions? Do the social institutions of reward and punishment depend for their justification upon the existence of responsible, free agents? We will discuss the nature of persons, action, freedom, and responsibility in an effort to answer these questions.</p>

We focus on six philosophers: Ren&eacute; Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Through their writings, we trace and study philosophical arguments and debates concerning the possibility and extent of our knowledge of the external world, the nature of the self, the nature of substance and causation, the existence of God, the nature of perception, and the relation between our minds and our bodies.</p>

What is the relation between knowledge and perception? Is it ever rational to believe in the absence of evidence?</p>

How do our mental states and attitudes, whatever&nbsp;they are, arise from activity in the brain and cause our actions?

This course examines&nbsp;various questions concerning the nature and&nbsp;practice of science that arise from this widespread&nbsp;attitude. For example, scientific theories are&nbsp;often thought to be subject to empirical scrutiny&nbsp;in ways that other theories are not. To what&nbsp;extent is this belief well-founded? Is it rational to&nbsp;believe that our best scientific theories are even&nbsp;approximately true? What justifies the claim that&nbsp;different types of evidence lend varying degrees&nbsp;of support to a particular theory, or that a single&nbsp;piece of evidence supports one theory more than&nbsp;another? Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific&nbsp;theories provide us with &ldquo;real&rdquo; explanations of&nbsp;physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;&ldquo;genuinely explanatory.&rdquo; To what extent is this&nbsp;true? What exactly is a scientific explanation, and&nbsp;how is it different (if at all) from a mere prediction&nbsp;or mathematical derivation? Can false theories&nbsp;provide good explanations? Some familiarity&nbsp;with science would be helpful but is not required.</p>

<p><strong>Attention</strong></p>

<p><em>Spring 2017</em></p>

<p>Virtually everything that happens in the mind consists in or is shaped by attention. Philosophers have claimed that it is impossible to be conscious of anything unless one attends to it; cognitive psychologists that attention is a fundamental cognitive function of working memory; novelists that attention is a cardinal virtue and a good in itself. Philosophers in South Asia have claimed something else for attention: that attention is essential to our identity as individuals and to our acknowledgement of others in social interaction. They have levered the notion of attention to construct accounts of human existence that are radical both in their divergence from the conception of persons inspired by the Abrahamic religions and in their cosmopolitan implications for social and political solidarity. Course readings will consist of classical and contemporary studies of attention across several philosophical traditions. Particular emphasis will be on the Theravāda Abhidhamma understanding of persons as beings with a capacity for attention, a view that shapes conceptions of humanity in South and Southeast Asia. Guest speakers from India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma will be invited, and their work read critically in advance.</p>

It is a program geared to prepare the body for better fitness by not focusing on any one activity. Rather,&nbsp;Total Fitness wants the body prepared for any and all activities or sports. It focuses on core strengthening and conditioning. It is not the same routine every day, but a regular mixture of activities designed to activate and strengthen various core and major muscle groups from a variety of tasks.&nbsp;Workouts are typically short&mdash;20 minutes or less&mdash;and intense, demanding all-out physical exertion. They combine movements such as sprinting, rowing, jumping rope, climbing rope, flipping tires, weightlifting, and carrying sandbags, kettlebells etc. CrossFit has attracted elite athletes, military personnel, police officers and now regular people who want to achieve higher levels of fitness.&nbsp;The Total Fitness program seeks to achieve this through balance in ten fitness categories: heart and lung endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance and accuracy.</p>

Trigger Point Therapy will relieve the muscle tightness and increase range of motion, facilitating efficient blood circulation. This actually increases energy levels, muscle strength and delays fatigue which is invaluable to the competitive athlete. The range of motion will enable you to use the full potential of the muscle and the restored muscle with improved blood supply; will be able to work harder for much longer, without tightening up on you. Essentially what this amounts to is a dramatic Improvement in your sports performance.<br />
Rehabilitation of muscles can bring about reduced pain and accelerated healing of injured tissue, Improved range of motion and muscle mass, Strengthening, conditioning, and weight loss and better overall well-being and improved quality of life.<br />
Muscle activation looks at the body compensations as it loses its ability to engage the prime movers of the body. These compensations reduce the ability of the body to work at its highest effectiveness, and increase the risk of injury.</p>

This, in turn, has the potential to facilitate the identification and practice of the next steps in your life&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp;This course will be taught by contracted instructors.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="148" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2013-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="7:00AM-8:30AM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section><section term="Fall 1 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:30-7:00 pm; W 6:00-7:30 pm" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js7443">Jen Shaffer  </professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2014-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:00-6:30 pm" days="UW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js7443">Jen Shaffer  </professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:00-6:30 pm" days="UW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section><section term="Fall 1 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="7:30-8:45 am" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js5887">Jim Savio</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:00-6:15 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section><section term="Spring 2 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:00-6:15 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section><section term="Spring 1 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:00-6:15 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section><section term="Fall 1 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:30-6:45 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js7443">Jen Shaffer  </professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:30-6:45 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js7443">Jen Shaffer  </professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="4:05 - 5:20 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"/></section></course><course peoplesoftID="PHYED-AD 48" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Triathlon Training</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Great class for anyone interested in doing a triathlon at least learning about the sport.

The goal in the lab is to determine what happened in a staged crime scene and identify the murderer. For that, clues left at the staged crime scene and beyond are analyzed using a combination of advanced scientific techniques (biological, chemical, and physical) typically used in forensics. In the lecture part of the course, the modern science and technology behind the techniques of forensic analysis are explored in depth. These tools of forensics are rooted in the fields of physics, physical chemistry, chemical physics, analytical chemistry, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. Examples include light microscopies, scanning electron microscopy and materials analysis, x-ray spectroscopies, various spectroscopies used for molecular identification such as infrared and Raman spectroscopies, mass spectroscopy and chromatography, electrophoresis, forensic serology, DNA sequencing, and next generation techniques.</p>

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and noncooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.</p>

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.</p>

This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles of social scientific experimentation and its uses. All types of social science experiments are explored: laboratory experiments, survey experiments, field experiments, and the new use of &quot;lab-in-the-field&quot; experiments. The course will discuss the issues of validity and artificiality in experimentation as well as the ethical concerns involved in experimental research. Students will have the opportunity to create and design their own experiment as part of the class. In the course students will learn how to use the software used to program experiments at the Social Science Experimental Laboratory. Note: this course should be taken by all social science students who plan to do experiments-based capstones in the laboratory.</p>

Among other questions, students will consider why we live in nation states, why peaceful solutions can be so elusive, and why the will of majority often goes unrealized. The course focuses on individual decision makers in the world of politics (citizens, voters, legislators) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape political outcomes. The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to illustrate how these theories of political behavior and institutions can shed light on current political events.</p>

Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to Machiavelli&rsquo;s tomb in Santa Croce; the David of Verrocchio in the Bargello (a statue that Machiavelli saw every day on his way to his office); and the estate at Sant&rsquo;Andrea in Percussina, near San Casciano in Val di Pesa, where Machiavelli retired to write The Prince.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="22" required="false"/><appears categoryID="131" required="false"/><section term="January 2013" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="849"><meeting times="BD" days="T" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sh33">Stephen Holmes</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2014" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1380"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sh33">Stephen Holmes</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2015" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sh33">Stephen Holmes</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2016" location="Florence, Italy" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:00-4:00 PM" days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sh33">Stephen Holmes</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 141X" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="22" required="false"/><appears categoryID="49" required="false"/><appears categoryID="58" required="false"/><appears categoryID="131" required="false"/><section term="Spring 1 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:00-3:40 PM" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sh33">Stephen Holmes</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2440"><meeting times="2:10-4:50 pm" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sh33">Stephen Holmes</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 142" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Justice: Political Theory &amp; Practice</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course invites students to engage with several classic treatises of political thinking about a universal concern: justice. In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know? In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:<br />
1.&nbsp;Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?<br />
2.&nbsp;What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="22" required="false"/><appears categoryID="76" required="false"/><appears categoryID="131" required="false"/><appears categoryID="138" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2739"><meeting times="2:10-3:25 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="reb11">Rachel Brule</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 143" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Gender Parity</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course introduces students to the basic theories, empiricism and methodological concepts of women&#39;s and gender studies within political science.

Here, identity is not treated as fixed but as constructed, and its formation itself an outcome to be explained. Students will examine identity and its relation to distributive politics, representation, political mobilization, conflict, and coordination.

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This imperviousness had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &ldquo;Arab exceptionalism&rdquo;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. Students will examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.</p>

Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. Students will design and execute a public opinion survey of US and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other&mdash;using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.</p>

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.</p>

The question remains, though, of how exactly does it matter? This question is the focus of this course. In the morning sessions, student are first introduced to the most important topics of political behavior&mdash;voting, turnout, partisanship, public opinion formation, and protests and social movements&mdash;and then to the much newer literature on the usage of social media. In the afternoon sessions, students both visit social media companies located in New York City, and are taught the necessary tools to work on their own original research projects.

The course begins with the historical roots of contemporary African politics, exploring how pre-colonial institutions and colonialism shaped African politics at independence. Next the course will survey the political and economic strategies of leaders post-independence and the factors shaping those strategies. The course includes an examination of the causes and consequences of poor governance, and evaluates the recent patterns of redemocratization on the continent. The course closes with a discussion of present-day challenges: electoral malfeasance, public health crises, the &ldquo;new&rdquo; populism, and China in Africa.</p>

The course begins with an examination of the state of Europe at the collapse of continental empires and will then consider the evolution of Communism as an ideology and an actual social, political, and economic practice. The bulk of the course is dedicated to the post-1989 period. Students will explore why some Eastern European countries were quick to democratize and liberalize, while others retrenched. Much of the course is focused on the evolution of society, economy, and polity in Russia. However, discussion will also include developments in all the former Soviet republics and, in a more cursory manner, across the former Communist bloc from Poland to Hungary.</p>

Yet every year, there are millions of preventable deaths. Many of these deaths occur in countries with very poor governance. What is the relationship between health and governance? How does the provision of effective health services affect government legitimacy, and vice versa? What are the roles of non-governmental actors in health care provision, and under what circumstances can the work of these actors be beneficial or detrimental to health outcomes and governance? What role do international organizations play in improving global health? The course examines these questions, and includes case studies of global health successes and failures, including smallpox eradication and the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Students will explore both historical and contemporary health issues, drawing on insights from political science, biology, and economics.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="127" required="false"/><appears categoryID="138" required="false"/><appears categoryID="76" required="true"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4728"><meeting times="11:50 - 1:05 pm " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mrp335">Melina Platas</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 165J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Nations, Nationalism and Beyond</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This class is dedicated to the study of nations and nationalism, &ldquo;national&rdquo; identities and its bearing on political systems and regimes (empires, federations, states, sub-state units and regions); political doctrines (liberalism, republicanism, multiculturalism, cosmopolitanism); and on international relations. We will study the history and the social construction of the state, of &ldquo;nation-states&rdquo;, of nations. We will then turn to the concept of nationalism, and evaluate the classical theories by considering empirical studies, adopting different angles and use international comparative examples. Nationalism is generally thought of as anti-liberal and hardly compatible with mature forms of democratic polities. Not only is this a historical error, but new and &ldquo;thin&rdquo; forms of nationalism have proven to be compatible with liberalism. Social justice, solidarity and integration of immigrants are often bound to national policies. The question whether particular forms of nationalism are desirable in multicultural settings will be left open for discussion. We will finally move on to transnational dimensions of identity: the recent boom of &ldquo;diaspora studies&rdquo;, the audience of &ldquo;legal or political cosmopolitanism&rdquo;, &ldquo;constitutional patriotism&rdquo; (in Europe in particular), or &ldquo;status group legal pluralism&rdquo; (regarding ethnies, historical nations, and religious groups), will serve as theoretical guidelines to understand how globalization shapes new forms of &ldquo;long-distance nationalism&rdquo; on the one hand, of new legal arrangements which serve to protect (national, ethnic, religious) minorities on the one hand, but seem at odds with democratic justice on the other hand.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="127" required="false"/><section term="January 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4647"><meeting times="9:00 am  - 12:00 pm" days="UMTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="as10943">Astrid Sadoun Von Busekist  </professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 170" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Introduction to International Politics</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The goal of this course is to introduce the basic analytical concepts and techniques that are essential for understanding international politics.

This issue is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &ldquo;democracy promotion&rdquo; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. The class will visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.</p>

The industrial revolution initially occurred in locations where coal was available. The discovery of oil, which provided a more transportable and more powerful source of energy, launched international competition for control of sources of oil. Oil cartels and powerful transnational oil companies have played vital roles in the politics, economics, and international policies of developed and developing nations, and access to oil has shaped the relationship of the Middle East to the world from the early 20th century to the present. This course explores these historical developments and considers how the need for energy has defined domestic politics and world developments over the past two centuries. Taking advantage of our location in Abu Dhabi, the course explores the relationship of an oil-producing region to the rest of the world.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="22" required="false"/><appears categoryID="128" required="false"/><section term="January 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1371"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="ak4785">Alan Kimball</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 183J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Emerging Powers</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Are Emerging Powers emerging, and are they powers?

Assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations (UN) provides the forum where states come together to discuss mutual problems. In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. In this course climate change will be taken as a case study and the many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis will be considered. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. In December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate agreement in Paris, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2&deg;C. The Paris Agreement will be open for signature at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 22 April 2016 to 21 April 2017. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the newly adopted climate change agreement. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing various governments in making progress with ratification process. It will try to seek the answers of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by Paris Agreement for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it be applicable to all Parties including the United States and China? Is the Paris Agreement a treaty? And is it the type of international agreement to which the United States is a party only if the US Senate ratifies it? The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC. In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions.</p>

What are impacts of these interventions? Students will study these questions in the context of India, the world&rsquo;s largest and most influential developing democracy, with some of the most complex, puzzling variation in economic and social rights. Specifically, the course will examine reforms that equalize women&rsquo;s rights to a core economic and social commodity: land. These reforms represent the hardest and most important reforms for the state to implement. The class will travel to India to interview top government officials and leaders responsible for implementing gender-equalizing land inheritance reform across India&rsquo;s diverse cultural, economic, and political landscape.</p>

Subsequent attacks in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere have focused the world&rsquo;s attention on the problem of Islamic terrorism. In this class we will seek to understand both the causes of the sudden rise of violent extremism in the Muslim world and the response it has provoked. This course will examine the evolution of the threat, from Al Qaeda, with its focus on mounting spectacular attacks on symbolic targets in the West, to the Islamic State, which has attracted thousands of men and women from around the world to its violent nation-building project in the heart of the Arab world. Western nations have deployed military, intelligence and police tactics against Al Qaeda with some success, but those methods may not work against ISIS. Arab nations have begun to mobilize to counter the threat, but their own repressive, and in some cases religiously intolerant, regimes may be exacerbating the very problem they seek to solve. In addition to reading about the origins and the spread of jihadism and the policies adopted by concerned states, we will meet with scholars, journalists, policy experts, diplomats and officials in the Obama administration. Students will write a series of short papers as well as a longer project proposing a course of action to cure, or at least mitigate, the extremist threat.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="22" required="false"/><appears categoryID="31" required="false"/><appears categoryID="49" required="false"/><appears categoryID="128" required="false"/><section term="January 2016" location="Washington, DC" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jst3">James Traub</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2017" location="Washington, DC" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:00 - 1:00 pm" days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jst3">James Traub</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 187" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>United Nations</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course examines the United Nations&rsquo; origin, processes and impact within both global and local contexts. The UN system, comprised of multiple organs, programs, funds and agencies, is a critical actor in international politics. It performs a large variety of daunting tasks ranging from keeping the peace in war-torn countries to fighting the spread of contagious diseases and facilitating negotiations to limit climate change&rsquo;s impact. While its status as the preeminent international organization is undisputed, its member states limit the UN&rsquo;s authority and both governments and NGOs frequently critique its structure and effectiveness. This course rigorously explores why the UN was established in 1945, how it has evolved, what challenges it faces today and whether avenues exist for meaningful organizational reform. The course will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of the UN&rsquo;s activities and will encourage students to use different theoretical approaches and available empirical evidence to think creatively about how the UN can more effectively address global challenges.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="22" required="false"/><appears categoryID="131" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:10-3:25 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mfh7">Michael Harsch</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mfh7">Michael Harsch</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 188J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Digital Diplomacy</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course will focus on the way that digital technology is reshaping the way that states interact and the building blocks of diplomacy.

This course will look at how new technology changes real world negotiations between leaders and the implications for secrecy, as trust has eroded. The course will consider how countries compete in the 21st century, and how smart power, new forms of communication and iDiplomacy will change the fundamentals of statecraft. Can diplomacy compete, evolve, survive, or will it be disrupted? How can we bring citizens closer to the biggest questions facing their future? The course will draw on history, but focus on practical examples from contemporary statecraft and the experiences of the instructor, an ambassador at the center of the effort to ensure that diplomacy is ready for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="22" required="false"/><appears categoryID="128" required="false"/><appears categoryID="172" required="false"/><appears categoryID="31" required="false"/><section term="January 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:00-4:00 pm" days="UMTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="tf51">Thomas Fletcher</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00 - 12:00 pm" days="UMTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="tf51">Thomas Fletcher</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="POLSC-AD 189" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Business, Politics, &amp; Society</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Business, Politics, &amp; Society (BPS) is a case-based MBA-style course that introduces students to the political economy of firms.

The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. Language affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, a feat that is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human. This course is open to all students but will not count towards the Psychology major.</p>

Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision-making.

Students will learn how vision works, from the low-level and unconscious analysis of sensory signals to the generation of perceptual awareness. Students will study how other higher functions such as attention, learning and working memory contribute to our visual experience of the world. Both functional and neurophysiological models of visual processing are addressed. An introduction to signal detection theory is provided. The course covers theoretical issues about vision, in particular whether perception constitutes a direct reflection of the outside world or rather inferential processes transforming the outside world into a private subjective reality. The course also addresses how one can design psychophysics experiments to address specific questions about the architecture and mechanisms of visual cognition. Students will see how visual illusions can inform us on how our brain deals, sometimes inappropriately, with external stimulations.</p>

We will begin with Freud&rsquo;s discovery of the psychoanalytic method in Studies on Hysteria and Piaget&rsquo;s classical essay on methods in The Child&rsquo;s Conception of the World. We will then read contemporary reflections on the challenges of psychological inquiry, including what modes of listening create trust, how to address the complexity of people&rsquo;s inner lives, and the cultural context of research. Research begins with a question, and the students will be asked to pose a &ldquo;real question,&rdquo; meaning something they don&rsquo;t know but want to know, and to conduct an interview with someone who might help them to answer their question. The Listening Guide method will be taught to illustrate a way of listening for and analyzing the psychological logic of an interview transcript or text.&nbsp;</p>

Interactions</em> introduces students to fundamental forces, including gravity and electrical forces. Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.</p>

changes in systems in the physical and living worlds. Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.</p>

Function</title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>Foundations of Science 4: Form and Function </em>explores a question applicable to all branches of science: How does the form or shape of a physical entity set its function? This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve the execution of that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography to examine chemical forms macroscopic and microscopic levels. Focused disciplinary tutorials in biology, chemistry, and physics provide an opportunity for in-depth analysis and discussion of classic papers, enhanced understanding of fundamental concepts, and development of practical skill sets. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.</p>

Change</em> focuses on disturbances in physical and living systems that bring about change. In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.</p>

Uncertainties</em> examines how repetitious or cyclical events, although presumably predictable, are associated with inherent uncertainty in their outcomes. This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution. Focused disciplinary tutorials in biology, chemistry, and physics provide an opportunity for in-depth analysis and discussion of classic papers, enhanced understanding of fundamental concepts, and development of practical skill sets. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.</p>

To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. The semester will start with the axioms of probability, from which students will develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, the class will consider both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course ends with an inference-based look at linear regression.</p>

They are perceived as &lsquo;social problems&rsquo; and divide public opinion about the appropriate ways to protect society from their deleterious effects. Lectures first focus on sociological perspectives on social problems and examine the role of social structure and social processes in their production and reproduction. Subsequent lectures focus on exploring selected social problems such as: suicide, suicide terrorism, euthanasia, aging, genocide, incest, genomics, and religious fundamentalism. The selected social problems are examined in a global perspective, focusing on contemporary industrialized societies.<br />

It begins in Venice with the first community to carry that name, and ends with Gaza, a place which the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in<br />the Palestinian Territories has argued evokes the worst historic memories of ghettoization. Along the way we explore the early modern Jewish ghettos of Frankfurt, Prague and Rome; Nazi-controlled ghettos in Poland during World War II; Jewish immigrant ghettos of early 20th-century New York and Chicago; and Black ghettos in northern U.S. cities from World War II to the present. Efforts to generalize to gay communities, Chinatowns, and barrios are also considered. As we trace the spread of the ghetto idea across history, we ask: what is it about this 16th century concept, coined for a now obsolete Jewish residential area, that continues to concern and captivate us?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="24" required="false"/><section term="Fall 1 2011" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2011-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2011-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:05-12:45" days="UW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mdd2001">Mitchell Duneier</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="SRPP-AD 116" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Revolutions and Social Change</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Revolutions mean purposive and contentious efforts to re-engineer whole societies according to the visions of justice and progress.

After considering classic social theories of religion, we will look at substantive cases from the United States, Egypt, Iran, China, and Venezuela to investigate how and why religious meanings and identities come to matter (or not) in arenas of gender equality, political mobilization, nation-state structures, everyday intergroup interactions, and the law and punishment. Overall, this course aims to provide students with the theoretical frameworks and substantive background necessary to analyze the workings of religion and religious identity in modern societies.</p>

For example, some estimates suggest that the richest 100 people in the world control half of all of the world&rsquo;s wealth, while billions of people around the globe survive are forced to survive on less than $2 a day. Our course will interrogate some of the key questions raised by rising inequality from a variety of perspectives. We will use our location in Accra as a laboratory for this investigation, taking advantage of the opportunity to both observe inequality and poverty up-close as well as exploring some of the ways in which governments and NGOs are attempting to ameliorate the worst of its effects. But we will frame our investigation in the global context: what happens in Accra is heavily shaped by larger global trends. We will ask: who is rich and who is poor, and how they are related to one another? To what extent is inequality (and even poverty) beneficial, harmful, or both to entire societies or key groups within them?</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="24" required="false"/><appears categoryID="41" required="false"/><appears categoryID="139" required="false"/><section term="January 2015" location="New York City" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jm3147">Jeff Manza</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2016" location="New York City" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jm3147">Jeff Manza</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2017" location="Accra, Ghana" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:00 - 2:00 pm" days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jm3147">Jeff Manza</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="SRPP-AD 134J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>21st-Century International Human Rights</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course is designed to give an introduction to the law, policy, philosophy, institutions, and practice of modern international human rights.

Here the complex processes of state-formation are still current, and the United Arab Emirates, which is barely forty years old, serves as a rich and richly varied example for the comparative understanding of state-building, cultural imagination, and economic development.</p>

The first section of the course provides a philosophical foundation for debates about women, work, and difference based on feminist theories. In particular, students will explore postcolonial perspectives on feminism and difference, feminist Marxist critiques of capitalism, and feminist Islamist critiques of modernity. The second part of the course provides an overview of how women in the Gulf feature in contemporary discourses as participants in &ldquo;globally competitive&rdquo; economies, mothers of &ldquo;future generations of citizens&rdquo;, and symbols of &ldquo;tradition and culture&rdquo;. The third part of the course provides an overview of the public policy and legal frameworks shaping women&rsquo;s work. In particular, this section of the course explores how different categories of &ldquo;women&rdquo; are produced through public policy programs such as workforce nationalization, education policy, social policy, and the interplay of national and international laws governing domestic work, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The course will host a number of academics, activists, and policymakers involved in policies shaping women&rsquo;s work experiences in the Gulf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="24" required="false"/><appears categoryID="58" required="false"/><appears categoryID="138" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2455"><meeting times="2:10-4:50 pm" days="U" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="md166">May Al-Dabbagh</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2010" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2010-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2010-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15-2:30 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="md166">May Al-Dabbagh</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="SRPP-AD 141" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Urban Poverty and Social Policy</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course explores theoretical and empirical connections between economic development, urbanization, urban poverty and distress and state/non-state responses to urban poverty and distress. The course begins with an exploration of theoretical and conceptual perspectives on urbanization and welfare state policies, then moves on to examine illustrative cases from global north and south cities that challenge and complicate reigning theories and concepts. The course begins with an historical and contemporary analysis of urban poverty in Global North cities (New York, Paris and London), then moves on to an examination of emergent urban poverty patterns and cases in rapidly-changing &ldquo;semi-peripheral&rdquo; regions (China, for example), and finally explores urban poverty in a wide variety of Global South cities (spanning Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia). The course will use examples from the United States to explore certain key topics/concepts for debate, such as &ldquo;underclass,&rdquo; &ldquo;informality,&rdquo; &ldquo;feminization of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;culture of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;prison industrial complex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;neo-liberal welfare state retrenchment.&rdquo; Students will be asked to compare and contrast historical and contemporary patterns of urban poverty across global north and south regions, with a focus on the limits and possibilities of social policies (state- and non-state-sponsored) for addressing urban distress.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="24" required="false"/><appears categoryID="41" required="false"/><appears categoryID="139" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="3:35-4:50 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dr101">Deirdre Royster</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="SRPP-AD 142" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Renewable Energy Law and Policy</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This introductory level course on renewable energy examines the historical and legal origins of energy regulations and emerging policies. The course provides an introduction to the renewable sources and basic terms and concepts, regulatory trends and other emerging issues. The primary focus of the course will be on renewable energy policies and laws of the developing countries. We will spend considerable time with Africa, Small Island States, United Arab Emirates, and examples from other countries. The centerpiece of this course is to focus on a specific renewable energy project (in a developing country) completed with international cooperation and assistance. The course will also focus on global institutions and policymaking, the divide between industrialized countries and developing countries, the nexus between global climate change and renewable energy, sustainable energy sources, and challenges that global policymakers will face in future. The course will look at the wide variety of local and regional laws, regulatory techniques, and policy objects. The class will embark on a week- long trip to a developing country to study renewable energy project and to get hands-on experience of power generation from a renewable energy facility.</p>

Traditional epidemiology focuses on demographic (e.g. age) and behavioral (e.g. physical activity) determinants of health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. This course will focus on Spatial Epidemiology, i.e. the spatial distribution and spatial determinants of health and wellbeing in human populations across the globe. For example, the course will elucidate connections between neighborhood (e.g. residential, social and work) characteristics (e.g. crime rate, density of fast food restaurants, distance to parks) and multiple health outcomes (e.g. obesity, mental health, substance use). The course will provide students with a historical, theoretical and methodological overview of the dynamic and re-emerging field of Spatial Epidemiology. This is an introductory-level course; as such, the course is intentionally broad, covering a range of issues and topics (e.g. neighborhood characteristic assessment methods, methods to examine neighborhood boundaries, identification of spatial clusters [&ldquo;hot spots&rdquo;] of disease, quantitative methods to evaluate connections between neighborhoods and health, and connecting neighborhoods to health disparities).</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="24" required="false"/><appears categoryID="138" required="false"/><section term="January 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:00-4:00 pm" days="UMTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="duncad05">Dustin Duncan</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:00 - 4:00 pm" days="UMTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="duncad05">Dustin Duncan</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="SRPP-AD 154J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Global Burden of Non-communicable Diseases</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Non-communicable diseases (NCD&rsquo;s) including heart disease, obesity, depression, and dementia were thought to impact the health of more developed, affluent countries while the major health issue for low and middle-income countries was acute infectious disease. Over the last decade, NCD&rsquo;s have begun to critically impact the health of most populations across the globe. This course seeks to identify a number of complex issues related to the emergence of NCD&rsquo;s globally and compare the disease experience in low and middle-income countries to high-income countries. Students will examine current trends in NCD&rsquo;s and define health burden as the overall impact of these diseases at the individual and at the societal level using a set of diverse health, lifestyle and economic indicators including disability adjusted life years, quality of life, and unemployment rates. The course will identify the social determinants of NCD&rsquo;s and explore the recent impact of the &ldquo;epidemiologic&rdquo; transition in low-income countries with emphasis on West Africa. With Ghana as the host country, students will participate in meetings, discussions and health department visits to understand NCD&rsquo;s and the impact of these diseases on the country&rsquo;s policy, culture and economy. &nbsp;</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="24" required="false"/><appears categoryID="138" required="false"/><appears categoryID="156" required="false"/><section term="January 2016" location="Accra, Ghana" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00 am-12:00 pm" days="MTWR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="bb109">Bernadette Boden-Albala</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="SRPP-AD 155J" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Child Development and Social Policy in a Global Society: Knowledge for Action</title><description><![CDATA[<p>The overarching goals of this course are to introduce students to: (1) the great variation in children&rsquo;s development in 2lst century global society; and (2) how public (government) and private (family, non-governmental and business) sector policies affect children&rsquo;s health, education and economic well-being in low-, middle- and high-income countries.

Keeping this in mind, this course will examine the unfolding of the &ldquo;development project&rdquo; in the postcolonial period and up to our present day in various Arab nation states. Beginning with an excerpt from the Arab Human Development Report, students will take a critical look at how development is defined and measured. Culture and religion have often been invoked as the major obstacles to development in the Arab World. This course will engage with this discourse as through exploring faces of modern day colonialism. What are the new tools and institutions of this new colonialism? How has this affected development and social struggle? The class will be organized around themes and corresponding case studies. Students will engage the idea of &ldquo;development&rdquo; in areas of education, economics, natural resources, women&rsquo;s rights, and social welfare. Students will also examine home-grown counter movements, focusing on youth efforts of organizing.</p>

The course is divided into two parts. The first half of the course will begin by introducing students to the theories of social movements, highlighting the different repertoires movements adopt based on the political and cultural contexts in which they are embedded. It will then move on to exploring the role of Islam in local and global social movements. Students will examine the roots, manifestations, and long-term implications of Islamist movements. How has Islam become the language of opposition in the Muslim world? What are the causes of popular mobilization that have collectively given rise to an &ldquo;Islamic revival&rdquo;? What kind of strategies do Islamist activists adopt? What do they want to accomplish? What are the broader social, political, and cultural impacts of such mobilizations? The second half of the course will turn to empirical cases of Islamist movements, analyzing their characteristics in relation to topics such as nationalism, colonialism, human rights, inequality, civil society, Sufism, and the role of women. Students will compare Islamist movements from a wide variety of countries in the region, including Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Lebanon, Palestine, Saudi Arabia as well as transnational and jihadi movements. The class will end with a discussion of the popular upheavals in the region commonly referred to under the rubric of the Arab Spring.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="138" required="false"/><appears categoryID="58" required="false"/><appears categoryID="131" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4477"><meeting times="11:50 - 1:05 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="zo2">Zeynep Ozgen</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="SRPP-AD 162" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Global Health and Economic Development</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course examines the relationships among poverty, disease, health and development.

Acting and performance are central to the process, but so is the recognition that a performance takes place in a space that has to be invested with rules and conventions before it can tell a story. Exploring the possibilities offered by these rules and conventions is key to understanding the potential for theater as a means of expression and mode of knowledge.

Acting and performance are central to the process, but so is the recognition that a performance takes place in a space that has to be invested with rules and conventions before it can tell a story. Exploring the possibilities offered by these rules and conventions is key to understanding the potential for theater as a means of expression and mode of knowledge. Combining the tools and techniques of Aristotle, Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Brecht, Grotowski, Brook, and Bogart, students work in groups to devise and stage silent stories as well as textual scenes to explore what it means to create a theatrical experience.

The course guides the student through awareness of and release from habitual tensions and into body alignment, breathing, resonators, sound and movement, group interaction, and the exploration of individual and group creativity. We focus on the kinetic application of movement in the art-making process, using core energy, dynamics, breath connection, strength, flexibility, range of motion, stamina, and relaxation techniques in order to strengthen our creative output. The goal is a free voice in a free body and the ability to express thought and emotion with openness and truth.</p>

The social turn explicitly rejects the artist&rsquo;s more traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance and instead proposes that the conscious processes of collaborative engagement -- activist, participatory, coauthored &ndash; must be understood and valued as art.&nbsp; In this intertwining of art with performance, cooperative processes are foregrounded as frameworks to understand and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art history, urban planning, and new media on our lives. The social practice of art proposes that in making encounters where artists engage with the members of communities as &ldquo;expert participants,&rdquo; we might construct more livable alternatives through social cooperation.&nbsp; Art as social practice also insists that this process is an aesthetic practice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this course we will read recent critical theories and histories of the aesthetics and politics of the social practice of art, explore case studies of &ldquo;relational art,&rdquo; and collaborate on our own &ldquo;living as form&rdquo; project.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="25" required="false"/><appears categoryID="30" required="false"/><appears categoryID="143" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2480"><meeting times="2:10-4:50 pm" days="U" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dl782">Debra Levine</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:55-5:35pm" days="U" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="dl782">Debra Levine</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="THEAT-AD 153" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>African Women Playwrights</title><description><![CDATA[<p>African Women Playwrights&rdquo; is a reading intensive course that focuses on the structurally and narratively diversified theatrical texts written by women from the continent in the 20th and 21st century. We&rsquo;ll critique the plays as both literature and dramatic texts intended for production. What is clearly evident in African women playwrights&rsquo; writing is its focus on women&rsquo;s agency; generational legacies; tradition, colonialism, and modernism; tribal and national identities; family relationships; intimacy and commitment; the spirit world of rituals, polytheism, and monotheism; the challenging coexistence between Christianity and Islam; the impact of the global diaspora on African identity; and the intersecting issues of blackness, Africanness, and womanhood. The course will address these various foci through the works of Andiah Kisia (Kenya), Nathalie Etoke, Werewere Liking (Cameroon), Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe), Fatima Gallaire (Algeria), Penina Mlama, Amadina Lihamba (Tanzania), Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua Sutherland (Ghana), Osonye Tess Onwueme, Zulu Sofola, Julie Okoh (Nigeria), Sindiwe Magona, Malika Ndlovu, Gcina Mhlope (South Africa), Violet Barungi, and Deborah Asiimwe (Uganda). The foundational critical theories for the course are postcolonialism, feminism, critical race theory, and diasporic studies. We will also engage the new plays by African women that are produced at the 2nd Annual Kampala International Theatre Festival (Nov 25-29, 2015) through the assistance of award-winning Ugandan playwright, Deborah Asiimwe, who is co-director of this East African theatre festival (as well as the representative for the Sundance Institute East Africa).</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="101" required="false"/><appears categoryID="143" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2015-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="3183"><meeting times="12:45-3:25 pm" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="rhv1">Robert Vorlicky</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z" syllabus="4183"><meeting times="11:50-2:30 PM" days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="rhv1">Robert Vorlicky</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="THEAT-AD 154" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Making the Anthropo[s]cene: Figuring Climate Change Across the Arts</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course will examine the range of artistic responses&mdash;across many genres and media&mdash;to the rapidly emerging and deeply confounding phenomena of climate change.&nbsp; Since these phenomena are accompanied by the paradox that they are, to a large extent anthropogenic (&ldquo;man-made&rdquo;), yet are also increasingly beyond the reach of human technological solutions or predictive models, they challenge us to revise our understanding of how our species relates to the non-human world around us.&nbsp; We will &nbsp;explore what artists and art criticism can learn from approaches emerging from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology (for example, Eduardo Kohn&rsquo;s <em>How Forests Think</em>), law (eg., Jedediah Prudy&rsquo;s <em>After Nature)</em>, philosophy of science (Bruno Latour&rsquo;s &ldquo;Waiting for Gaia&rdquo;), politics (Naomi Klein&rsquo;s <em>This Changes Everything</em>) and philosophy (Elizabeth Grosz <em>Becoming Undone</em>), etc. We will study a variety of literary, cinematic, visual, and pop-cultural art works, such as Wallace Shawn&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Grasses of a Thousand Colors</em>, Marina Zurkow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Necrocracy,&rdquo; Alan Sekula&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Forgotten Space,&rdquo; Nick Hayes&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Rime of the Modern Mariner,&rdquo; Jeff Nichols&rsquo; <em>Take Shelter</em>, Laars Von Trier&rsquo;s <em>Melancholia</em>, Richard McGuire&rsquo;s <em>Here</em>, Mike Barnett&rsquo;s <em>Earthquakes in London</em>, Shonni Enelow&rsquo;s <em>Carla and Lewis, </em>Beyonce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Formation,&rdquo; and many more. &nbsp;</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="7" required="false"/><appears categoryID="34" required="false"/><appears categoryID="14" required="false"/><appears categoryID="59" required="true"/><appears categoryID="60" required="false"/><appears categoryID="101" required="false"/><appears categoryID="84" required="false"/><appears categoryID="99" required="true"/><appears categoryID="143" required="false"/><appears categoryID="18" required="false"/><appears categoryID="35" required="false"/><appears categoryID="38" required="false"/><appears categoryID="83" required="false"/><appears categoryID="81" required="true"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15 - 2:30 PM " days="TR" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="uc1">Una Chaudhuri</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="THEAT-AD 160" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Fundamentals of Playwriting</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course engages the basic principles of the craft of play writing with strong emphasis on characterization, dialogue, and structure, including identification of the major dramatic incident and turning points.

The primary area of interest is not works of art but rather other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of Visual Culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction.

Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulating detail.

From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the UAE State Calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="8" required="false"/><appears categoryID="61" required="false"/><appears categoryID="146" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2 2012" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="7 Weeks" startDate="2012-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2012-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:10-12:50" days="UW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gp56">Goffredo Puccetti</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2012" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2012-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2012-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:35-3:50" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gp56">Goffredo Puccetti</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1532"><meeting times="1:20-4:00 pm; W 1:00-2:15 pm" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gp56">Goffredo Puccetti</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="5:00 - 8:00 PM " days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gp56">Goffredo Puccetti</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:10-3:25 pm; R 2:10-4:50 pm" days="T" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gp56">Goffredo Puccetti</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 W 2:40 - 5:20 pm" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="gp56">Goffredo Puccetti</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="VISAR-AD 119" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Contemporary Global Art</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Since the 1960s rise of conceptual art, artists around the world continue to create idea-based art using popular imagery, mixed media, photography and new technologies.

We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualizations of sculpture since the 1960s that have led to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. What sort of public should a sculptural intervention take into account and how does this public differ from the audience at an art gallery? What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="8" required="false"/><appears categoryID="61" required="false"/><appears categoryID="146" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2015" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2015-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2015-05-31T00:00:00Z" syllabus="2725"><meeting times="9:15-11:55 AM; W 9:15-10:30 AM" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sp159">Sandra Peters</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00-10:15 AM; R 9:00-11:40 AM" days="T" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="sp159">Sandra Peters</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="VISAR-AD 150X" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Islamic Art and Architecture</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course surveys the architecture, painting, and decorative arts of the Islamic world, from North Africa to central Asia, between the 7th and 18th centuries.

This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qur&rsquo;an where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational figure in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the Peoples of the Book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and this seminar examines both. Students will study gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. To analyze these works, the course introduces fundamental methods of art history as an academic discipline. The seminar includes fieldtrips to gardens and collections in the United Arab Emirates and India, and concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="7" required="false"/><appears categoryID="60" required="false"/><appears categoryID="147" required="false"/><section term="January 2013" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2013-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2013-01-15T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="BD" days="T" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mhw1">Mariet Westermann</professor></meeting></section><section term="January 2014" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="3 Weeks" startDate="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2014-01-15T00:00:00Z" syllabus="1369"><meeting times="" days="" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="mhw1">Mariet Westermann</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="VISAR-AD 166" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Foundations of Art History I</title><description><![CDATA[<p>These courses offer detailed engagements with key works of art -- masterpieces to material culture across a range of media from different times and places -- to develop the critical apparatus of visual analysis.

This interdisciplinary seminar will study the masterpieces and material culture produced during Europe&rsquo;s first sustained overseas contact with the rest of the world in the early modern period (16th-18th centuries). Looking closely at the new categories and new geographies of objects fostered by the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British maritime trade routes, this course will reconsider traditional approaches to art history and weigh the new methods and revisions these curious images suggest. Objects will be studied from the perspectives of how they conceptualized &ldquo;world,&rdquo; how histories of exploration and collecting intersected, how personal and communal identities were manufactured, and how political diplomacy and subversion impacted them and in turn were affected. Serious attention will be devoted to honing the craft of researching and writing a major research paper, step by step, in preparation for a capstone thesis in the humanities.</p>

Such activities and creations have sought to initiate an understanding of the world that would ultimately lead to a new cultural, economic, social, and political environment. This movement has involved experimentation and the creation of an awareness of possibilities never thought of before as well as a constant change and competition, especially in the arts.

This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art.

Essential to printmaking is the production of multiples and repetition. This class will introduce several printmaking media and techniques including, but not limited to: drypoint, woodcut, linocut, screenprinting and monotype. The focus will be on fine art printmaking. The technical aspects of each technique will be presented and then investigated through in-class demonstrations, readings, and slide lectures, all designed to tie the history of printmaking with hands-on learning. Success in this course depends on combining technique with strong concepts, the development of an aesthetic, and a willingness to take risks to challenge your abilities and ideas. Through group critiques you will learn to speak effectively about and to analyze your work and the work of others, questioning the decisions made in the development of the image, and assessing how successfully the technical and conceptual work together to communicate ideas.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="61" required="false"/><appears categoryID="146" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="9:00 - 10:15 W 9:00-1140 (LAB)" days="M" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jf139">Jonny Farrow</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="VISAR-AD 205" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Sound Art</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Students in this course will produce sculptural and site-specific works of Sound Art, using sound, materials, and space as their palette. The class will focus its study on artists who primarily work with sound in gallery-based situations and the surrounding fine art discourses. While the term &ldquo;Sound Art&rdquo; is not as old, the practice of using sound in the context of gallery-based visual arts as both material and concept stretches back over 100 years, and comes from various artists and art movements, such as Marcel Duchamp, the Futurists, Dada, and forward to the happenings of Fluxus, the Minimalists, specifically Robert Morris, and through to the procedural art making methods of John Cage and the countless artists he influenced. According to Alan Licht, the term &ldquo;Sound Art&rdquo; dates back to 1982 with the founding of William Hellermann&rsquo;s Sound Art Foundation, which organized an early show of sound sculpture and other work at the Sculpture Center (NYC) in 1983. Around the turn of the 21st century, many more high profile exhibitions of sound art were mounted with varying curatorial approaches serving to further broaden the use of the term. We will examine the use of the term carefully and draw our own conclusions about its utility, while exploring the use of sound to unlock sculptural, architectural, material, and conceptual potentials. There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="61" required="false"/><appears categoryID="146" required="false"/><appears categoryID="109" required="false"/><appears categoryID="30" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="1:15 - 2:30 R 1:15 - 3:45 pm" days="T" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="jf613">Jonny Farrow</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="VISAR-AD 300" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Thinking Art</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course offers engagements with the problems and methods of Art History at an advanced level.

A king returning from war finds his adulterous wife in a murdering mood, and before long he is dead. A wife betrayed by her philandering husband slaughters her two children as revenge. Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus&rsquo;s Agamemnon and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle&rsquo;s, Hegel&rsquo;s, and George Steiner&rsquo;s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan&rsquo;s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world.

In this&nbsp;<em>First-Year Writing Seminar,</em>&nbsp;we challenge that assumption. Taking contemporary popular culture as a point of departure, we delve into debates from history, sociology, and literary studies in order to understand the social construction of taste, giving special attention to the complex role that &ldquo;good taste&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad taste&rdquo; can play in perpetuating social hierarchies.&nbsp; You will have the opportunity to further develop your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills while examining how ideas about &ldquo;taste&rdquo; are constructed, interrelated, and how they can inform, limit, or inspire the way we see ourselves in our social worlds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Like all First Year Writing Seminars, this class asks students to write 3 essays of increasing complexity (in draft and final form) over the course of the term, culminating in a research paper and oral presentation.We begin by working on the art of close reading by analyzing the role of taste in a work of art or a cultural practice.&nbsp; The first brief essay will analyze such a text, making an argument about its embedded ideas regarding taste. Then, we consider key 20th century theories regarding the social construction of taste. In the second paper students will reckon with a theory of their choice by making an argument about its limits and/or enduring legitimacy by applying it to a specific visual text (a film or ad campaign).&nbsp; Finally, for the 3rd paper, students conduct original research on an independently designed topic, investigating &ldquo;taste&rdquo; in a case study of their choosing.&nbsp;</p>

We know where we are (and where we are from) partly because we have physical experiences of those places: a grandmother&rsquo;s kitchen, a smell of the city, the particular light on Scandinavian summer nights, or the sound of the jungle. However, what happens when geographies and their relation to identity&mdash;national and/or personal&mdash;are merely imagined in a variety of different texts? In this seminar, we will read a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts in order to investigate how space and national and/or personal identity is imagined. Furthermore, we will investigate how texts open a space for the reader to imagine worlds personally unknown, thereby forcing us to also think about our own lived and imagined geographies. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this Writing Seminar will revisit some of the contemporary debates about the history, society, and culture of Islam. We begin by grappling with contesting representations of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; by Bernard Lewis, Edward Said, Robert Spencer and Samuel Huntington. We then delve into some of prominent sites of conflict and tension brought to the fore by such events as the Charlie Hebdo affair and the Burka controversy as well as the rise in Islamophobia in Europe. For the research paper, students will focus on the role of struggle and conflict in &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. Possible topics will revolve around issues of extremism, radicalization, and terrorism. Finally, students will deliver a short presentation on a recent ongoing debate of Islam.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="53" required="false"/><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 pm U 2:55-5:35 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="msk15">Sohail Karmani</professor></meeting></section><section term="Fall 2016" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2016-09-01T00:00:00Z" endDate="2016-12-23T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="10:25 - 11:40 am U 2:55 - 5:35 pm " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="msk15">Sohail Karmani</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="WRIT-AD 143" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Ghastly Beauty</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Why do Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies offer us hope? What makes a movie about a drug addicted professional wrestler more a story about love than the violence inherent his life? How does a beautiful painting or song make us cry? Art flourishes in a world of opposites and contradictions. Art is reflective and provocative, reactionary and thoughtful, private and public. As one of our oldest methods of documenting what we see, it also reconfigures and transforms what we imagine. This freshman writing seminar will serve as an introduction to these tensions, and the social, political and material roles that art plays in our life. It will familiarize you with academic writing, and further develop your critical reading, thinking and writing skills. It will draw from a range of art forms that explore both current social issues, and more enduring questions.</p>

Other writers regard its universal aspirations as a &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to &ldquo;Western&rdquo; values. Still others remain skeptical that the shari&lsquo;a was ever meant to be universal. &nbsp;Without answering the question of whether it is, was, or should be &ldquo;universal,&rdquo; this writing course investigates the debates that the question has inspired. &nbsp;How do different writers perceive the universality of shari&lsquo;a? &nbsp; What are the political, ethical, or other stakes of arguments about shari&lsquo;a&rsquo;s universality? &nbsp;Readings connect theoretical approaches to individual case studies in milieus as diverse as shari&lsquo;a courts in Ottoman Turkey, fatwa councils in contemporary Egypt, and divorce proceedings in Iran. Through creative and critical writing assignments, students explore the contexts, motives, and forms of evidence brought to bear by authors who contribute to ongoing debates about the ways we understand shari&lsquo;a today.</p>

Artists, filmmakers, journalists and activists have described and adopted this position for a range of purposes. In this writing seminar we will discover why outsiders are essential, and how they can be just as dangerous. The figure of &ldquo;the outsider&rdquo; is often clueless &ndash;or in over his head &ndash; &nbsp;or ignorant. But ignorance can be liberating, fostering open-mindedness and a chance to weave complexity back into dead narratives. Crucially, analyzing the role of the outsider across a range of texts and cultures will help us question the act of belonging. Biss&rsquo;s Notes From No Man&rsquo;s Land will aid in our investigation, as will essays by Binyavanga Wainaina and Suketu Mehta. In order to understand outsiders with adopted countries we will consider Katherine Boo&rsquo;s book about Mumbai&rsquo;s destitute, Behind the Beautiful Forevers. Since &ldquo;the outsider&rdquo; is sometimes seen as a master manipulator and exploiter, we will also watch documentaries by Mads Brugger and Joshua Oppenheimer to critique these claims. Then we will ask&ndash; who exploits whom?</p>

How do different cultures understand writing? How is writing valued and assessed? How do we learn to write? What happens when we consider the process of writing a complex affective and neurological process? These are some of the questions we will be entertaining in this Writing Seminar.&nbsp; We will do so by studying not only how writers write but, more importantly, how writers make sense of both their writing and their process.</p>

<p>It is seemingly the simplest of acts: sit down, get out a pen or put your fingers to the keyboard, and start transferring thought into written matter. However, the act of writing is a complex neurological, psychological, imaginative, and cultural practice. In this Writing Seminar we focus on writers and their expressive practice in an attempt to understand the process and material manifestation of writing. A fundamental tenet of the class is that writers and writing must be understood in their cultural and contextual complexities.</p>

<p>In the first unit, we will focus our attention on short texts by writers on how and why they write. Readings may include texts by Charles Bukowski, Lydia Davis, Joan Didion, V. S. Naipul, Susan Sontag, and theoretical readings by Aristotle, Rousseau, Michel Foucault, Richard Miller, and Peter Elbow. In the second unit we engage writers&rsquo; memoirs, in particular Stephen King&rsquo;s <em>On Writing: a Memoir on the Craft</em>, Alice Weaver Flaherty&rsquo;s <em>The Midnight Disease: the Drive to Write, Writer&rsquo;s Block, and the Creative Brain</em> and Kazim Ali&rsquo;s <em>Bright Felon </em>in order to ask questions about writing as narrative praxis and sense-making. Finally, throughout the class, students will be asked to keep journals reflecting on their own practices. These auto-ethnographies will serve as the impetus for our third unit in which students will be asked to locate an area of inquiry based in their own practice and develop a small research project.</p>]]></description><appears categoryID="53" required="false"/><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55 pm U 2:55 - 5:35 pm " days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="kn38">Ken Nielsen</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="WRIT-AD 149" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="true"><title>&#x201C;Jazz me, baby!&#x201D;: Rotten Englishes</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Pidgdins, creoles, patois and slang: there are so many Englishes!&nbsp; From Jamaica and Ireland, to America and India, from Spanglish and Hinglish to Londonstani slang and Black English, these languages have developed and shaped nations and canons.&nbsp; This Writing Seminar is a broad exploration of writing produced in recent decades by Anglophone writers from the Americas, Africa and South Asia and the theoretical questions raised by such writing.&nbsp; Our sampling will consider fiction and film that ranges from traditionally realist to formally experimentalist, short stories variously characterized as anti-colonial and Afro-pessimist, fiction by new writers and also by Nobel laureates, poetry about immigrant women and also the land-owning elite, and fiction that has been well-canonized and deconstructed as well as important writing that has been more or less forgotten.&nbsp; Drawing on your analysis of these texts, you will be asked to produce several essays in draft and final form in which you make original arguments about the politics of writing in the English language.

Though we tend to take it for granted (with the rise of selfies, SnapChat and Instagram for instance), photography promises us unprecedented intimacy and access to the images it captures. &nbsp;But is this intimacy merely a technical illusion? &nbsp;How do photographs alter the way we see and know the world? This FYWS explores these age-old questions, paradoxes born along with the birth of the medium.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Photography is more than its ubiquitous presence: photography furnishes us with potentially powerful insights into the recent past, into remote corners of the world, and into unfolding current events. Drawing on the work of Sontag, Barthes, Berger and others, this Writing Seminar analyzes not only the power of photography to shape and influence our consciousness but also its limitations in terms of how we come to &lsquo;know&rsquo; the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We begin first with the power of photography, particularly in the context of social documentary. How do documentary photos illuminate the fundamental tension between &lsquo;photography as art&rsquo; and &lsquo;photography as documentary&rsquo;? By reckoning with a range of sources that help shed light on the power that photography confers on us&mdash;both as creators and consumers of images&mdash;we lay the foundation to then delve into the ethics of a specific kind of seeing and knowing: what are the moral implications of intruding on and capturing pain, suffering, and death in photographs? &nbsp;And finally, having explored the ways in which photography creates the illusion of intimacy, proximity, &nbsp;and privileged &nbsp;access, we discuss the role of photography in representing social or cultural remoteness. By drawing upon Edward Said&rsquo;s orientalist framework, for example, we look at how representations of &lsquo;otherness&rsquo; help reinforce existing power structures and dominant narratives about &lsquo;us&rsquo; and &lsquo;them&rsquo;.</p>]]></description><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="2:40 - 3:55  pm U 10:25 - 1:05 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="msk15">Sohail Karmani</professor></meeting></section><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="11:50 - 1:05 pm U 10:25 - 1:05 pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="msk15">Sohail Karmani</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="WRIT-AD 151" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="true"><title>&#x201C;Cowboys &amp; Indians&#x201D;: Mythologies of American Identity</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Images and depictions of the American West offer a repository of profound and enduring stories, some dating back thousands of years, far in advance of the European &ldquo;discovery.&rdquo; Art and literature depicting the American frontier and its complex indigenous cultures reflect a wide array of beliefs and ideologies. This Writing Seminar invites students into a close and careful examination of the written, oral and visual representations of the American West in order to analyze and explore the mythologies that contribute to a national identity.</p>

<p>These representations are often set against a backdrop of unimaginable physical beauty and natural wonder. Yet in them we also find unprecedented violence and racism. The social, political, and philosophical movements influencing Europe (among them colonialism, romanticism, capitalism, socialism, existentialism, and racism)<strong> </strong>followed the &ldquo;pioneers&rdquo; across the plains. This Writing Seminar will explore and analyze these tensions that seem to define the &ldquo;American character&rdquo;: the tribal versus the rugged individual, progress and our disregard for the natural world, tolerance and the intolerable, nostalgia for a vanishing landscape in the wake of unbridled development, law and order and frontier justice. These mythic tales about the promise of America continue to fascinate and frustrate. All of it-- the &lsquo;good the bad <em>and</em> the ugly&rsquo;-- have contributed to the representations of what it means to be &ldquo;American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To help us consider questions of genre, the course will consider<em> </em>stories and essays by American and Native American writers. We will begin with <em>The Sun&rsquo;s Myth</em>, a story in the oral tradition of the Kathlamet Chinook, and a Navajo Night Chant, <em>House Made of the Dawn, </em>translated by Washington Matthews<em> and </em>Dorothy Johnson. Students will be asked to engage in a close formal analysis of a range of visual and written texts, from John Gast&rsquo;s painting, <em>American Progress, </em>to the essay &ldquo;Manifest Destiny &ndash;A Belief System that Created a Nation,&rdquo; to the journalism of Jane Cazneau and an excerpt from the <em>Journals of Lewis and Clark</em>. To help us reckon with the ethics of storytelling and representation we will consider &ldquo;classic Westerns&rdquo; such as <em>High Noon</em> and <em>The Magnificent Seven</em>, and &ldquo;revisionist Westerns&rdquo; such as <em>Thunderheart, Little Big Man</em>, as well as &nbsp;<em>Reel Injuns</em> (2009), a documentary by Cree filmmaker Neil Diamond.</p>]]></description><section term="Spring 2017" location="Abu Dhabi" duration="14 Weeks" startDate="2017-01-15T00:00:00Z" endDate="2017-05-31T00:00:00Z"><meeting times="4:05 - 5:20 pm U 2:55 - 5:35pm" days="MW" isDiscussion="false" isLab="false"><professor netid="js5887">Jim Savio</professor></meeting></section></course><course peoplesoftID="WRIT-AD 210" isCapstone="false" hasDiscussion="false" hasLab="false" writing="false"><title>Advanced Analysis and Expression</title><description><![CDATA[<p>This course builds upon the skills from Analysis and Expression and the Writing-Intensive Core courses to prepare students for advanced writing across the curriculum.&nbsp; The course calls upon students to be creative, critical, and curious, as they rigorously practice their written and spoken expression.&nbsp; Students engage with a variety of texts and research topics to gain greater self-awareness and confidence with their writing.&nbsp; Each major assignment is the result of a progression of exercises with an emphasis on drafting and revision strategies.

Our discussions will be driven by the essential question: How is art similar to language and how is it different? The class will examine the form of the Petrarchan sonnet and Michelangelo&rsquo;s intention to use the sonnet form as a means of artistic expression. We will further explore how his sonnets are connected to the visual art he created. Upon observation of the artist&rsquo;s sculptures, instructors will facilitate discussion of the language used to respond to the visual expression as a strategy for understanding the world. In doing so, we will investigate the difference between of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; and &ldquo;viewing&rdquo; as a method of analysis. Students will identify the principal themes that connect all forms of his artistic expression, including commitment to artistic endeavors and psychological imprisonment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Students will be given the opportunity to express a conceptual claim from the artist with a visual medium. Together we will explore whether the intentions of the artist can be conveyed more plausibly with words or through sculpture. Our discussion will address whether art is an imitation of words or a source of knowledge that can stand alone without words. What can be communicated without words? Does Michelangelo&rsquo;s writing serve as an inspiration for his sculpture or do his sculptures further ignite his writing?<br />
Did the existence of an artist like Michelangelo keep a certain type of language or art alive and thus help others to see the world with new eyes?</p>
